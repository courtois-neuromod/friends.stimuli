1,1,monica:," okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date. it's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex."
1,1,chandler:, sounds like a date to me. 
1,1,chandler:," alright, so i'm back in high school, i'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and i realize i am totally naked."

1,1,joey:, never had that dream.
1,1,phoebe:, no.
1,1,chandler:," all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. now i don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
1,1,monica:, and they weren't looking at you before?!
1,1,chandler:," finally, i figure i'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very very weird, because she never calls me! "

1,1,joey:," this guy says hello, i wanna kill myself."
1,1,monica:," are you okay, sweetie?"

1,1,monica:, no you don't.
1,1,ross:," no i don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
1,1,joey:, and you never knew she was a lesbian...
1,1,ross:," no!! okay?! why does everyone keep fixating on that? she didn't know, how should i know?"
1,1,chandler:, sometimes i wish i was a lesbian... did i say that out loud?
1,1,ross:," i told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well."
1,1,monica:," oh really, so that hysterical phone call i got from a woman at sobbing 3 a.m., ""i'll never have grandchildren, i'll never have grandchildren."" was what?  a wrong number?"
1,1,ross:, sorry.
1,1,joey:," alright ross, look. you're feeling a lot of pain right now. you're angry. you're hurting. can i tell you what the answer is? "
1,1,joey:," strip joint! c'mon, you're single! have some hormones!"
1,1,ross:," i don't want to be single, okay? i just... i just i just wanna be married again! "
1,1,chandler:, and i just want a million dollars! 
1,1,monica:, rachel?!
1,1,rachel:," oh god monica hi! thank god! i just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
1,1,waitress:, can i get you some coffee?
1,1,monica:," de caff. okay, everybody, this is rachel, another lincoln high survivor. this is everybody, this is chandler, and phoebe, and joey, and you remember my brother ross? "
1,1,rachel:," hi, sure!"
1,1,ross:, hi. 
1,1,monica:," so you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?"
1,1,rachel:," how much barry looks like mr. potato head. y'know, i mean, i always knew looked familiar, but... anyway, i just had to get out of there, and i started wondering 'why am i doing this, and who am i doing this for?'. so anyway i just didn't know where to go, and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person i knew who lived here in the city."
1,1,monica:, who wasn't invited to the wedding.
1,1,rachel:," ooh, i was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... "
1,1,monica:," now i'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
1,1,chandler:, tuna or egg salad?  decide!
1,1,ross:, i'll have whatever christine is having.
1,1,rachel:," daddy, i just... i can't marry him! i'm sorry. i just don't love him. well, it matters to me! "
1,1,phoebe:,"  if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off. "
1,1,chandler:," ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. "
1,1,joey:,  push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs! 
1,1,rachel:," c'mon daddy, listen to me! it's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a a purse, y'know? or a or a hat! no, i'm not saying i want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying i am a ha it's a metaphor, daddy!"
1,1,ross:, you can see where he'd have trouble.
1,1,rachel:," look daddy, it's my life. well maybe i'll just stay here with monica. "
1,1,monica:," well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica..."
1,1,rachel:," well, maybe that's my decision. well, maybe i don't need your money. wait!! wait, i said maybe!! "
1,1,monica:," just breathe, breathe.. that's it. just try to think of nice calm things..."
1,1,phoebe:," raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and something with mittens... la la la la...something and noodles with string.  these are a few..."
1,1,rachel:, i'm all better now.
1,1,phoebe:, i helped!
1,1,monica:," okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? independence. taking control of your life.  the whole, 'hat' thing."
1,1,joey:," and hey, you need anything, you can always come to joey. me and chandler live across the hall. and he's away a lot."
1,1,monica:," joey, stop hitting on her! it's her wedding day!"
1,1,joey:," what, like there's a rule or something? "
1,1,chandler:," please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."

1,1,monica:," oh god, is it 6 ?  buzz him in!"
1,1,joey:, who's paul?
1,1,ross:," paul the wine guy, paul?"

1,1,ross:, he finally asked you out?
1,1,monica:, yes!
1,1,chandler:," ooh, this is a dear diary moment."
1,1,monica:," rach, wait, i can cancel..."
1,1,rachel:," please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
1,1,monica:," are, are you okay? i mean, do you want me to stay?"
1,1,ross:, that'd be good...
1,1,monica:, really?
1,1,ross:," no, go on! it's paul the wine guy!"
1,1,phoebe:," what does that mean?   does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? "
1,1,monica:," hi, come in! paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is paul."
1,1,all:, hey! paul! hi! the wine guy! hey!

1,1,joey:,"  hey, paul!"
1,1,paul:, yeah?
1,1,joey:," here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red."
1,1,monica:," shut up, joey!"
1,1,ross:," so rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?"
1,1,rachel:," well, i was kinda supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
1,1,ross:," right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, god.. no, no, although, aruba, this time of year... talk about your big lizards... anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
1,1,chandler:," yes, and we're very excited about it. "
1,1,rachel:," well actually thanks, but i think i'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  it's been kinda a long day."

1,1,ross:," i'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. i have no brackety thing, i see no whim guys whatsoever and i cannot feel my legs. "
1,1,joey:, i'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
1,1,chandler:, it's a beautiful thing.
1,1,joey:, what's this?
1,1,chandler:, i would have to say that is an 'l' shaped bracket.
1,1,joey:, which goes where?
1,1,chandler:, i have no idea. 
1,1,joey:, done with the bookcase!
1,1,chandler:, all finished!
1,1,ross:," this was carol's favorite beer. she always drank it out of the can, i should have known."
1,1,joey:," hey hey hey hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
1,1,chandler:," yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
1,1,joey:," ross, let me ask you a question. she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv what did you get?"
1,1,ross:, you guys.
1,1,chandler:," oh, god."
1,1,joey:, you got screwed.
1,1,chandler:, oh my god! 
1,1,monica:, oh my god!
1,1,paul:," i know, i know, i'm such an idiot. i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. i mean, how clean can teeth get?"
1,1,monica:," my brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. how did you get through it?"
1,1,paul:," well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her "
1,1,monica:, leg?
1,1,paul:," that's one way! me, i i went for the watch."
1,1,monica:," you actually broke her watch?  wow!  the worst thing i ever did was, i i shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
1,1,paul:," ooh, steer clear of you."
1,1,monica:, that's right. 
1,1,rachel:," barry, i'm sorry... i am so sorry... i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and i ju hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become mrs. barry finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  and not that i have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... "
1,1,ross:, i'm divorced!  i'm only 26 and i'm divorced!
1,1,joey:, shut up!
1,1,chandler:, you must stop! 
1,1,ross:, that only took me an hour.
1,1,chandler:," look, ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento.   you, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  i don't think that was my point!"
1,1,ross:," you know what the scariest part is? what if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? i mean what if you get one woman and that's it? unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman for her..."
1,1,joey:," what are you talking about? 'one woman'? that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. lemme tell you something, ross. there's lots of flavors out there. there's rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing! cherry vanilla. you could get 'em with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! this is the best thing that ever happened to you! you got married, you were, like, what, eight? welcome back to the world! grab a spoon!"
1,1,ross:, i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny.
1,1,chandler:, stay out of my freezer! 
1,1,paul:," ever since she walked out on me, i, uh..."
1,1,monica:," what?..... what, you wanna spell it out with noodles?"
1,1,paul:," no, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation."
1,1,monica:," oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
1,1,paul:, isn't there?
1,1,monica:," yeah... yeah, i think there is. what were you gonna say?"
1,1,paul:," well, ever ev ... ever since she left me, um, i haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...sexually. "
1,1,monica:," oh god, oh god, i am sorry... i am so sorry..."
1,1,paul:, it's okay...
1,1,monica:, i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. um... how long?
1,1,paul:, two years.
1,1,monica:, wow! i'm i'm i'm glad you smashed her watch!
1,1,paul:," so you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?"
1,1,monica:," we are gathered here today to join joanne louise cunningham and charles, chachi chachi chachi, arcola in the bound of holy matrimony."
1,1,rachel:, oh...see... but joanne loved chachi! that's the difference! 
1,1,ross:," grab a spoon. do you know how long it's been since i've grabbed a spoon? do the words 'billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? "
1,1,joey:," great story!  but, i uh, i gotta go, i got a date with andrea angela andrea...  oh man, "
1,1,chandler:," angela's the screamer, andrea has cats."
1,1,joey:, right.  thanks.  it's june.  i'm outta here. 
1,1,ross:," y'know, here's the thing. even if i could get it together enough to to ask a woman out,... who am i gonna ask? "
1,1,rachel:," isn't this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life."
1,1,chandler:, that is amazing.
1,1,joey:, congratulations. 
1,1,rachel:," y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there isn't anything i can't do."
1,1,chandler:," if can invade poland, there isn't anything i can't do."
1,1,joey:," listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a western omelet or something... although actually i'm really not that hungry..."
1,1,monica:," oh good, lenny and squigy are here."
1,1,all:, morning. good morning.
1,1,paul:, morning.
1,1,joey:," morning, paul."
1,1,rachel:," hello, paul."
1,1,chandler:," hi, paul, is it? "
1,1,paul:, thank you!  thank you so much!
1,1,monica:, stop!
1,1,paul:," no, i'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in witness."
1,1,monica:, we'll talk later.
1,1,paul:, yeah. thank you. 
1,1,joey:, that wasn't a real date?! what the hell do you do on a real date?
1,1,monica:," shut up, and put my table back."
1,1,all:, okayyy! 
1,1,chandler:," all right, kids, i gotta get to work. if i don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
1,1,rachel:," so, like, you guys all have jobs?"
1,1,monica:," yeah, we all have jobs. see, that's how we buy stuff."
1,1,joey:," yeah, i'm an actor."
1,1,rachel:, wow! would i have seen you in anything?
1,1,joey:, i doubt it. mostly regional work.
1,1,monica:," oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the reruns' production of pinocchio, at the little theater in the park."
1,1,joey:," look, it was a job all right?"
1,1,chandler:," 'look, gippetto, i'm a real live boy.'"
1,1,joey:, i will not take this abuse. 
1,1,chandler:," you're right, i'm sorry. ""once i was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
1,1,joey:," you should both know, that he's a dead man.  oh, chandler? "
1,1,monica:, so how you doing today? did you sleep okay? talk to barry? i can't stop smiling.
1,1,rachel:, i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
1,1,monica:," i know, he's just so, so... do you remember you and tony demarco?"
1,1,rachel:," oh, yeah."
1,1,monica:," well, it's like that. with feelings."
1,1,rachel:, oh wow. are you in trouble.

1,1,monica:," i think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. okay. okay. i am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. or else i'm just gonna get up and go to work."
1,1,rachel:," oh, look, wish me luck!"

1,1,rachel:, i'm gonna go get one of those job things. 
1,1,frannie:," hey, monica! "
1,1,monica:," hey frannie, welcome back! how was florida? "
1,1,frannie:," you had sex, didn't you? "
1,1,monica:, how do you do that?
1,1,frannie:," oh, i hate you, i'm pushing my aunt roz through parrot jungle and you're having sex!  so? who? "
1,1,monica:, you know paul? 
1,1,frannie:," paul the wine guy? oh yeah, i know paul. "
1,1,monica:, you mean you know paul like i know paul? 
1,1,frannie:," are you kidding? i take credit for paul. y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. "
1,1,joey:, of course it was a line! 
1,1,monica:," why?! why? why, why would anybody do something like that? "
1,1,ross:, i assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. 
1,1,monica:, i hate men!  i hate men!
1,1,phoebe:," oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe."
1,1,monica:, is it me? is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 
1,1,phoebe:," all right, c'mere, gimme your feet. "
1,1,monica:," i just thought he was nice, y'know? "
1,1,joey:, i can't believe you didn't know it was a line! 
1,1,rachel:, guess what? 
1,1,ross:, you got a job? 
1,1,rachel:, are you kidding? i'm trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today. 
1,1,chandler:, and yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 
1,1,rachel:," you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off! "
1,1,chandler:," oh, how well you know me... "
1,1,rachel:," they're my new 'i don't need a job, i don't need my parents, i've got great boots' boots! "
1,1,monica:, how'd you pay for them? 
1,1,rachel:," uh, credit card. "
1,1,monica:, and who pays for that? 
1,1,rachel:, um... my... father. 
1,1,rachel:," oh god, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  i mean, i can stop charging anytime i want. "
1,1,monica:," c'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. "
1,1,rachel:, i know that. that's why i was getting married. 
1,1,phoebe:," give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. "
1,1,rachel:, thank you. 
1,1,phoebe:," you're welcome. i remember when i first came to this city. i was fourteen. my mom had just killed herself and my step dad was back in prison, and i got here, and i didn't know anybody. and i ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel. "
1,1,ross:, the word you're looking for is 'anyway'... 
1,1,monica:," all right, you ready?"
1,1,rachel:," no.  no, no, i'm not ready!  how can i be ready?  ""hey, rach!  you ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?""  come on, i can't do this!"
1,1,monica:," you can, i know you can! "
1,1,rachel:, i don't think so.
1,1,ross:," come on, you made coffee!   you can do anything! "
1,1,ross:," c'mon, cut. cut, cut, cut,... "
1,1,all:," cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... "
1,1,rachel:, y'know what?  i think we can just leave it at that.  it's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
1,1,monica:,  rachel!  that was a library card! 
1,1,all:," cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.."
1,1,chandler:," y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
1,1,monica:, welcome to the real world! it sucks. you're gonna love it! 
1,1,monica:," well, that's it you gonna crash on the couch? "
1,1,ross:," no. no, i gotta go home sometime. "

1,1,rachel:, i knew. 
1,1,ross:, you did! oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother. 
1,1,rachel:, i did. 
1,1,ross:," oh. listen, do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out? sometime? maybe? "
1,1,rachel:," yeah, maybe... "
1,1,ross:," okay... okay, maybe i will... "
1,1,rachel:, goodnight. 
1,1,ross:, goodnight. 
1,1,monica:," see ya.... waitwait, what's with you? "
1,1,ross:, i just grabbed a spoon. closing credits

1,2,phoebe:," oh, yeah! "
1,2,rachel:, everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
1,2,monica:, absolutely. 
1,2,chandler:," yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? i mean it's like the stand up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out. "
1,2,ross:," yeah, and and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that that... that's not why we bought the ticket. "
1,2,chandler:," the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. "
1,2,rachel:," bring back the comedian. otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. "
1,2,joey:," museum of prehistoric history, ross and a co worker are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.] "
1,2,ross:," no, it's good, it is good, it's just that mm doesn't she seem a little angry? "
1,2,marsha:," well, she has issues. "

1,2,ross:," marsha, these are cave people. okay? they have issues like 'gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' see? "
1,2,marsha:," speaking of issues, isn't that your ex wife? "

1,2,chandler:," oh, i think this is the episode of three's company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
1,2,phoebe:,...then i've already seen this one! 
1,2,monica:, are you through with that? 
1,2,joey:," yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. "
1,2,monica:, whose little ball of paper is this?! 
1,2,chandler:," oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i didn't need it, so i balled it up and... ...now i wish i was dead. "
1,2,phoebe:," she's already fluffed that pillow... monica, you know, you've already fluffed that but, it's fine! "
1,2,monica:," look , i'm sorry, guys, i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. "
1,2,chandler:," yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. "
1,2,phoebe:," monica hi! um, monica, you're scaring me. i mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. and not not in a good way. "
1,2,joey:," yeah, calm down. you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. "
1,2,monica:," that's because as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong. y'see, he's the prince. apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born. "
1,2,chandler:," ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! "
1,2,monica:, what? 
1,2,chandler:, ugly naked guy got a thighmaster! 
1,2,all:, eeaagh!

1,2,phoebe:," yeah, it's beautiful. "
1,2,rachel:," oh god, oh god, oh god oh god oh god oh god.... "
1,2,phoebe:," no, look, don't touch that! "
1,2,rachel:," oh, like i wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'hi barry! remember me? i'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' oh god and now i'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... "
1,2,monica:, oh! yeah!
1,2,joey:," alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
1,2,phoebe:, doy! probably right before she lost it! 
1,2,chandler:, you don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
1,2,rachel:," i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with... "
1,2,chandler:, ...dinah? 
1,2,rachel:," ohhhhh, don't be mad... "
1,2,monica:, you didn't. 
1,2,rachel:," oh, i am sorry... "
1,2,monica:, i gave you one job! 
1,2,rachel:," oh, but look how straight those noodles are! "
1,2,chandler:," now, monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... "
1,2,monica:, i just... can't do it. 
1,2,chandler:, boys? we're going in. 
1,2,ross:, .....hi. 
1,2,monica:, wow. that is not a happy hi.

1,2,chandler:," kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon? "
1,2,rachel:," well now, how how do you fit into this whole thing? "
1,2,ross:," well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved, but if i'm not comfortable with it, i don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. "
1,2,phoebe:, she is so great! i miss her. 
1,2,monica:, what does she mean by 'involved'? 
1,2,chandler:," i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. "
1,2,ross:," anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow. "
1,2,rachel:, so what are you gonna do? 
1,2,ross:," i have no idea. no matter what i do, though, i'm still gonna be a father. "
1,2,joey:," oh, martha ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. mmm! what's that curry taste? "
1,2,monica:, mmmm! 
1,2,ross:, they all had a thing for him. 
1,2,ross:," aw, mom... "
1,2,monica:," oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... i don't know. anyway, i told her you had a restaurant "
1,2,monica:," well, they don't have to know that... "
1,2,monica:," ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? "
1,2,ross:," oh, we're having spaghetti! that's.... easy. "
1,2,monica:," well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... "
1,2,monica:, nothing! it's an expression. 
1,2,monica:," ...and i read about these women trying to have it all, and i thank god 'our little harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. "
1,2,monica:," so, ross, what's going on with you? any stories? no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? "
1,2,ross:, and you knew about this?! commercial break 
1,2,joey:," your folks are really that bad, huh? "
1,2,ross:," well, y'know, these people are pros. they know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. "
1,2,monica:," boy, i know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could i'd want yours. "
1,2,ross:, must pee. 
1,2,phoebe:," y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. "
1,2,rachel:, you're twins? 
1,2,phoebe:," yeah. we don't speak. she's like this high powered, driven career type. "
1,2,chandler:, what does she do? 
1,2,phoebe:, she's a waitress. 
1,2,rachel:," all right, you guys, i kinda gotta clean up now. "
1,2,monica:," chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this. "
1,2,chandler:," well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. "
1,2,rachel:," the lights, please.. "

1,2,ross:, mm. 
1,2,rachel:," so, got any advice? y'know, as someone who's recently been dumped? "
1,2,ross:," well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, i know it'll be hard. or, y'know, uh, hey!, i'll go down there, and i'll give barry back his ring, and you can go with carol and susan to the ob/gyn... "
1,2,rachel:," oh, you've got carol tomorrow.. when did it get so complicated? "

1,2,susan:," oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? he knows no one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her geller, then he gets his way! "

1,3,all:," hey, pheebs! hi! "
1,3,ross:," hey. oh, oh, how'd it go? "
1,3,phoebe:," um, not so good. he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again!' "
1,3,all:, ohh. ouch. 
1,3,rachel:," what? he said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? "
1,3,monica:," uh, no. loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'. "
1,3,rachel:, since when? 
1,3,joey:," since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'. "
1,3,chandler:, or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
1,3,phoebe:," or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, i already am'. "
1,3,rachel:, and everybody knows this? 
1,3,joey:, yeah. cushions the blow. 
1,3,chandler:," yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. "
1,3,ross:," that's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. "
1,3,monica:," uh, ross. "
1,3,ross:," what? wh hello? the millners' farm in connecticut? the millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was it w .....oh my god, chi chi! opening credits "
1,3,chandler:," ""so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"" "
1,3,joey:," ""warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."" "
1,3,chandler:," hey, that was really good! "
1,3,joey:, thanks! let's keep going. 
1,3,chandler:," okay. ""so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?"" "
1,3,joey:," ""i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke."" "
1,3,chandler:," ""smoke away."" "
1,3,chandler:, i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone. 
1,3,joey:, what? 
1,3,chandler:, relax your hand! 
1,3,chandler:, not so much! 
1,3,joey:, whoah!

1,3,chandler:," alright, now try taking a puff. "
1,3,chandler:, alright.. okay. no. give it to me. 
1,3,joey:," no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette. "
1,3,chandler:," it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here. "
1,3,chandler:," don't think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. when you're holding it, you feel right. you feel complete. "
1,3,joey:, y'miss it? 
1,3,chandler:," nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke. oh.. my.. god. "
1,3,monica:," no, no, no. they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. "
1,3,joey:, that's ridiculous! 
1,3,ross:, can i use.. either thumb? 
1,3,rachel:," alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! decaf cappucino for joey.. coffee black.. late.. and an iced tea. i'm getting pretty good at this! "

1,3,phoebe:," it's nothing, it's just okay. i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly, you know, statement "
1,3,ross:, easy. 
1,3,phoebe:, and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
1,3,chandler:," oh, satan's minions at work again... "
1,3,phoebe:," yes, 'cause now i have to go down there, and deal with them. "
1,3,joey:, what are you talking about? keep it! 
1,3,phoebe:," it's not mine, i didn't earn it, if i kept it, it would be like stealing. "
1,3,rachel:," yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! "
1,3,phoebe:," okay. okay, let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes. do you know what i'd hear, with every step i took? 'not mine. not mine. not mine.' and even if i was happy, okay, and, and skipping 'not not mine, not not mine, not not mine, not not mine'... "
1,3,monica:, we're with you. we got it. 
1,3,phoebe:, okay. i'd just i'd never be able to enjoy it. it would be like this giant karmic debt. 
1,3,rachel:," chandler, what are you doing? "
1,3,monica:, hey. whaddya doing? 
1,3,all:," oh! oh, god! "
1,3,ross:, what is this?!

1,3,phoebe:," oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years! "
1,3,chandler:, and this is my reward! 
1,3,ross:," hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit. "
1,3,chandler:," okay, so this time i won't quit! "
1,3,all:, ohhh! put it out! 
1,3,chandler:," all right! i'm putting it out, i'm putting it out. "

1,3,monica:," look, i don't even know how i feel about him yet. just give me a chance to figure that out. "
1,3,rachel:," well, then can we meet him? "
1,3,monica:, nope. schhorry. 
1,3,monica:," i mean, why should i let them meet him? i mean, i bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. i mean, they're like coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. "
1,3,paula:," that is not such a terrible thing. i mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. "
1,3,monica:," i know. i just wish that once, i'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. "
1,3,paula:," well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. "
1,3,joey:," let it go, ross. "
1,3,ross:," yeah, well, you didn't know chi chi. "
1,3,monica:, do you all promise?

1,3,ross:, ...so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 
1,3,rachel:," what future boyfriends? nono, i th i think this could be, y'know, it. "
1,3,monica:, really!

1,5,chandler:," oh, right, right, shut up."
1,5,monica:," chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. you just gotta do it."
1,5,chandler:," no, i know, but it's just so hard, you know? i mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
1,5,joey:," why do you have to break up with her? be a man, just stop calling. "
1,5,phoebe:," you know, if you want, i'll do it with you."
1,5,chandler:," oh, thanks, but i think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. "
1,5,phoebe:," no, i mean you break up with janice and i'll break up with tony. "
1,5,ross:, tony?
1,5,monica:," oh, you're breaking up with tony?"
1,5,phoebe:," yeah, i know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? i don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, i don't know."

1,5,monica:," did he give you that whole ""you're not up to this"" thing again?"
1,5,rachel:," oh, yeah, yeah. actually, i got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""you'll never make it on your own""."

1,5,rachel:, don't you have a laundry room in your building?
1,5,ross:," yes, i do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. anyway, say, sevenish?"
1,5,rachel:, sure. 
1,5,angela:, forget it joey. i'm with bob now.

1,5,ross:, no.
1,5,chandler:," oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
1,5,ross:," ok, ok, now what is wrong with my snuggles? what, it says i'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. ok, i can pick something else up on the way."

1,5,ross:," rach, have you never done this before?"
1,5,rachel:," well, not myself, but i know other people that have. ok, you caught me. i'm a laundry virgin."
1,5,ross:," uh, well, don't worry, i'll use the gentle cycle. ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under panty things."
1,5,rachel:," ok, well, what about these are white cotton panties. would they go with whites or delicates?"
1,5,ross:," uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call. "

1,5,monica:, wow. my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
1,5,angela:, huh. that's nice. 
1,5,phoebe:," ok, you can do this. it's just like pulling off a band aid. just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. "

1,5,janice:," all right. well, there you go. stop it, stop it, stop it. "

1,6,chandler:," hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... chandler! chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi."
1,6,aurora:," yes, you said that."
1,6,chandler:," yes, yes i did, but what i didn't say was what i was about to say, what i wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. "
1,6,aurora:, chandler? 
1,6,all:, hey! you're in a play! i didn't know you could dance! you had a beard!

1,6,rachel:, what is it?
1,6,joey:," the estelle leonard talent agency. wow, an agency left me its card! maybe they wanna sign me!"
1,6,phoebe:, based on this play? ...based on this play! 
1,6,chandler:," hey, kids. "
1,6,all:, hey.
1,6,phoebe:," no, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line."
1,6,chandler:," well, i can't believe i've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went."
1,6,monica:," oh, right, right. how was your date, 'chand lrr'?"
1,6,chandler:, it was unbelievable. i i've never met anyone like her. she's had the most amazing life! she was in the israeli army... 
1,6,aurora:," ...luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. so, we made it to the border, but just barely, and i ...i've been talking about myself all night long, i'm sorry. what about you? tell me one of your stories."
1,6,chandler:," alright. once i got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and i rode it all the way to brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
1,6,chandler:, we talked 'til like two. it was this perfect evening... more or less.
1,6,aurora:, ...all of a sudden we realised we were in yammon. 
1,6,chandler:," oh, i'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
1,6,aurora:, 'we' would be me and rick.
1,6,joey:, who's rick?
1,6,chandler:, who's rick?
1,6,aurora:, my husband.
1,6,all:, ooooohhh.
1,6,chandler:," oh, so you're divorced?"
1,6,aurora:, no.
1,6,chandler:," oh, i'm sorry, then you're widowed?...hopefully?"
1,6,aurora:," no, i'm still married."
1,6,chandler:," so tell me, how do how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
1,6,aurora:," don't worry. i imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with ethan."
1,6,chandler:," ethan? there's, there's an ethan?"
1,6,aurora:, mmmm... ethan is my... boyfriend.
1,6,all:, what?!
1,6,chandler:," so explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?"
1,6,aurora:, i suppose mainly sexual.
1,6,chandler:, ...hm.
1,6,monica:, oh. i'm sorry it didn't work out.
1,6,chandler:, what 'not work out'? i'm seeing her again on thursday. didn't you listen to the story?
1,6,monica:," didn't you listen to the story? i mean, this is twisted! how could you get involved with a woman like this?"
1,6,chandler:," all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. i mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
1,6,phoebe:," oh, yeah. that is not true. ross, is this your fantasy?"
1,6,ross:," no, of course not! ...yeah, yeah, it is."
1,6,monica:, what? so you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
1,6,joey:, i couldn't do it.
1,6,monica:," good for you, joey."
1,6,joey:," when i'm with a woman, i need to know that i'm going out with more people than she is."
1,6,ross:," well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. i mean, anthropologically speaking "
1,6,ross:," fine. fine, alright, now you'll never know."
1,6,monica:," we're kidding. c'mon, tell us!"
1,6,all:, yeah! c'mon!
1,6,ross:," alright. there's a theory, put forth by richard leakey "
1,6,rachel:, tah daaah!
1,6,chandler:, are we greeting each other this way now? 'cause i like that.
1,6,rachel:," look! i cleaned! i did the windows, i did the floors... i even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, i don't know what that's for."
1,6,ross:," oh yeah, nobody knows. and we're not supposed to ask."
1,6,rachel:," well, whaddya think?"
1,6,all:, very clean! it looks great! terrific!
1,6,monica:, ...oh! i i see you moved the green ottoman.
1,6,all:, uh oh...
1,6,monica:, how how did that happen?
1,6,rachel:," i dunno.. i i thought it looked better there. and i and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table."
1,6,monica:," yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. alright, just to compare. let's see. well, it looks good there too. let's just leave it there for a while."
1,6,phoebe:, i can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
1,6,chandler:," thank god you didn't try to fan out the magazines. i mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
1,6,monica:," you guys, i am not that bad!"
1,6,phoebe:," yeah, you are, monica. remember when i lived with you? you were like, a little, y'know, ree! ree! ree! ree!"
1,6,monica:, that is so unfair!
1,6,ross:," oh c'mon! when we were kids, yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn't raggedy!"
1,6,monica:," okay, so i'm responsible, i'm organised. but hey, i can be a kook."
1,6,ross:," alright, you madcap gal. try to imagine this. the phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away."
1,6,monica:, why not?
1,6,ross:, because you're a kook! instead you wait until they send you a notice.
1,6,monica:, i could do that.
1,6,rachel:," okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and i buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy pour spout."
1,6,monica:, why would someone do that?! ...one might wonder.
1,6,chandler:," someone's left a glass on the coffee table. there's no coaster. it's a cold drink, it's a hot day. little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."
1,6,monica:, stop it!! ...oh my god. it's true! who am i?
1,6,ross:, monica? you're mom. 
1,6,phoebe:, ree! ree! ree! ree! ree! 
1,6,joey:," uh huh.. uh huh... oh my god! okay! okay, i'll be there! that was my agent. my agent has just gotten me a job...in the new al pacino movie!"
1,6,all:, oh my god! whoah!
1,6,monica:," well, what's the part?"
1,6,joey:," can you believe this? al pacino! this guy's the reason i became an actor! ""i'm out of order? pfeeeh. you're out of order! this whole courtroom's out of order!"""
1,6,phoebe:," seriously, what what's the part?"
1,6,joey:," ""just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in!"""
1,6,ross:," c'mon, seriously, joey, what's the part?"
1,6,joey:, ...i'm his 
1,6,rachel:," ..you're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
1,6,joey:," ...i'm his butt double. 'kay? i play al pacino's butt. alright? he goes into the shower, and then i'm his butt."
1,6,monica:, oh my god.
1,6,joey:," c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that's big!"
1,6,chandler:," oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness."
1,6,joey:," okay, okay, fine! make jokes, i don't care! this is a big break for me!"
1,6,ross:," you're right, you're right, it is...so you gonna invite us all to the big opening? commercial break "
1,6,monica:," alright, alright, alright... "
1,6,joey:, here. i need to borrow some moisturizer.
1,6,monica:, for what?
1,6,joey:, whaddya think? today's the big day!
1,6,monica:," oh my god. okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
1,6,joey:, thank you! 
1,6,chandler:, where's joey? his mom's on the phone.
1,6,monica:, he's in the bathroom. i don't think you wanna go in there!
1,6,chandler:," c'mon, we're roommates! my eyes!! my eyes!!"
1,6,monica:, i warned you... 
1,6,rachel:, who is being loud?
1,6,chandler:," oh, that would be monica. hey, listen, i wanna borrow a coupla things, aurora spent the night, i really wanna make her breakfast."
1,6,monica:," oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
1,6,chandler:," yeah, well, i only have twenty minutes until ethan, so, y'know.. "
1,6,rachel:," ooh, do i sense a little bit of resentment?"
1,6,chandler:," no, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'kay? y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? well, every single second is like that with aurora.. and i've just wasted about thirty five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. monica, can you help me with the door? "
1,6,monica:," sure. oh, um, chandler? y'know, the the old monica would would remind you to scrub that teflon pan with a plastic brush...but i'm not gonna do that. "
1,6,director:," ...dammit, hire the girl! okay, everybody ready?"
1,6,joey:," uh, listen, i just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
1,6,director:, lose the robe.
1,6,joey:, me?
1,6,director:, that would work.
1,6,joey:, right. okay. losing the robe. and the robe is lost.
1,6,director:," okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action. "
1,6,director:," and cut. hey, butt guy, what the hell are you doing?"
1,6,joey:," well, i'm i'm showering."
1,6,director:," no, that was clenching."
1,6,joey:," oh. well, the way i see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? i mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... i think his butt would be angry here."
1,6,director:," i think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. what was that?"
1,6,joey:, i was going for quiet desperation. but if you have to ask... 
1,6,chandler:," god, i love these fingers..."
1,6,aurora:, thank you.
1,6,chandler:," no, actually i meant my fingers. look at 'em, look at how happy they are."
1,6,aurora:," oh my god, i'm late. "
1,6,chandler:," oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. "
1,6,aurora:, okay.
1,6,chandler:, don't go.
1,6,aurora:," okay. oh no, i have to."
1,6,chandler:," too bad, she's leaving."
1,6,aurora:, i'm sorry. he'll be waiting for me.
1,6,chandler:," well, i thought i thought you talked to rick."
1,6,aurora:, it's not rick.
1,6,chandler:," what, ethan? he got to spend the whole day with you!"
1,6,aurora:," no, it's it's andrew. "
1,6,chandler:," i know there'll be many moments in the years to come when i'll regret asking the following question, but and andrew is?"
1,6,aurora:, he's... new.
1,6,chandler:," oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself?"
1,6,aurora:," no, that's not exactly what i was.."
1,6,chandler:," well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
1,6,aurora:, so what do you want?
1,6,chandler:, you.
1,6,aurora:, you have me!
1,6,chandler:," nono, just you."
1,6,aurora:, whaddyou mean?
1,6,chandler:, lose the other guys.
1,6,aurora:," ...like, ...all of them?"
1,6,chandler:," c'mon, we're great together, why not?"
1,6,aurora:," why can't we just have what we have now? why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight i thought that's what you wanted too."
1,6,chandler:," ...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like i'm two guys, y'know? i mean, one guy's going 'shut up! this is great!' but there's this other guy. actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... and he's saying, y'know, 'this is too hard! get out! get out!'"
1,6,aurora:, so... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
1,6,chandler:," i don't know, i i have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish..."
1,6,aurora:, which one?
1,6,chandler:, ...the second guy.
1,6,aurora:," well, call me if you change your mind. "
1,6,chandler:," sorry, the first guy runs the lips. "
1,6,ross:," you dumped her. right? i mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... tell me why you did this again? "
1,6,all:, hey!
1,6,monica:," hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new al pacino movie?"
1,6,joey:, nope.
1,6,ross:," no? what happened, big guy?"
1,6,chandler:," ""big guy?"""
1,6,ross:, it felt like a 'big guy' moment.
1,6,joey:, i got fired.
1,6,all:, oh!
1,6,joey:," yeah, they said i acted too much with it. i told everybody about this! now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
1,6,rachel:," oh, joey, you know what, no one is gonna be able to tell."
1,6,joey:, my mom will.
1,6,chandler:, something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
1,6,joey:," y'know, i've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. and i finally get my shot, and i blow it!"
1,6,monica:, maybe this wasn't your shot.
1,6,ross:," yeah, i mean... i think when it's your shot, y'know, you you know it's your shot. did it... feel like your shot..?"
1,6,joey:," hard to tell, i was naked."
1,6,phoebe:," no, i don't think this was your shot. i mean, i don't even think you just get one shot. i really believe big things are gonna happen for you, i do! you've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'i got the part! i got the part! i'm gonna be joey tribbiani's ass!'."
1,6,joey:, yeah? that's so nice! 
1,6,monica:," i'm sorry, joey. i'm gonna go to bed, guys. "
1,6,all:, night.
1,6,rachel:," uh, mon, you you gonna leave your shoes out here?"
1,6,monica:, uh huh!
1,6,rachel:, really? just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
1,6,monica:," doesn't matter, i'll get 'em tomorrow. or not. whenever. "
1,6,ross:, she is a kook. closing credits 
1,6,monica:," if it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. no. don't do this. this is stupid! i don't have to prove anything, i'm gonna go get them...but then everyone will know. unless i get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...i need help! "
1,7,rachel:," everybody? shh, shhh. uhhh... central perk is proud to present the music of miss phoebe buffay. "
1,7,phoebe:," hi. um, i want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. ok, here we go. ok, thank you very much. "
1,7,chandler:," oh, great. this is just... opening credits "
1,7,rachel:," wow, this is so cool, you guys. the entire city is blacked out!"
1,7,monica:," mom says it's all of manhattan, parts of brooklyn and queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on."
1,7,rachel:," wow, you guys, this is big."
1,7,monica:," pants and a sweater? why, mom? who am i gonna meet in a blackout? power company guys? eligible looters? could we talk about this later? ok. "
1,7,phoebe:, can i borrow the phone? i want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. what's my number? 
1,7,phoebe:," well, i never call me. "
1,7,chandler:," oh my god, it's that victoria's secret model. something... something goodacre."
1,7,jill:," hi mom, it's jill."
1,7,chandler:," she's right, it's jill. jill goodacre. oh my god. i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre! is it a vestibule? maybe it's an atrium. oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
1,7,jill:," yeah, i'm fine. i'm just stuck at the bank, in an atm vestibule."
1,7,chandler:, jill says vestibule... i'm going with vestibule.
1,7,jill:," i'm fine. no, i'm not alone... i don't know, some guy."
1,7,chandler:," oh! some guy. some guy. 'hey jill, i saw you with some guy last night. yes, he was some guy. "
1,7,joey:, hi everyone.
1,7,ross:," and officiating at tonight's blackout, is rabbi tribbiani."
1,7,joey:," well, chandler's old roomate was jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... happy chanukah, everyone."
1,7,phoebe:," eww, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles. "
1,7,rachel:, that had to hurt! 
1,7,chandler:," alright, alright, alright. it's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. oh god, do something. just make contact, smile! "
1,7,chandler:, there you go! 
1,7,chandler:, you're definitely scaring here.
1,7,jill:, would you like to call somebody? 
1,7,chandler:," yeah, about 300 guys i went to high school with. yeah, thanks. "

1,7,joey:," oh my god! he's trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre! chandler, listen. "
1,7,chandler:," yeah, like that thought never entered my mind. "
1,7,rachel:," alright, somebody."
1,7,monica:," ok, i'll go. ok, senior year of college... on a pool table."
1,7,all:, whoooaa!
1,7,ross:, that's my sister.
1,7,joey:, ok... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the new york city public library.
1,7,monica:, oh my god! what were you doing in a library?
1,7,ross:," pheebs, what about you?"
1,7,phoebe:, oh... milwaukee.
1,7,rachel:, um... ross?
1,7,ross:," disneyland, 1989, 'it's a small world after all.'"
1,7,all:, no way!
1,7,ross:," the ride broke down. so, carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom."
1,7,phoebe:," oh, rachel."
1,7,rachel:," oh come on, i already went."
1,7,monica:, you did not go!
1,7,all:, come on.
1,7,rachel:," oh, alright. the weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed. "
1,7,ross:, step back.
1,7,joey:, we have a winner! 
1,7,rachel:," i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
1,7,ross:," well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
1,7,rachel:," there, well, see? barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. "
1,7,ross:, come on.
1,7,rachel:," no, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
1,7,ross:, and you didn't marry him because...?
1,7,rachel:," i mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of..."
1,7,ross:," probably. but you know, i'll tell you something. passion is way overrated."
1,7,rachel:, yeah right.
1,7,ross:," it is. eventually, it kind of... burns out. but hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex wife, lesbianism. so, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff."
1,7,rachel:, ok.
1,7,ross:," but, um... i don't think that's going to be you."
1,7,rachel:, you don't.
1,7,ross:," uh uh. see, i see.... big passion in your future."
1,7,rachel:, really?
1,7,ross:, mmmm.
1,7,rachel:, you do?
1,7,ross:, i do.
1,7,rachel:," oh ross, you're so great. "
1,7,joey:, it's never gonna happen.
1,7,ross:, what?
1,7,joey:, you and rachel.
1,7,ross:, what? why not?
1,7,joey:," because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. "
1,7,ross:," no, no, no. i'm not in the zone."
1,7,joey:," ross, you're mayor of the zone."
1,7,ross:," i'm taking my time, alright? i'm laying the groundwork. yeah. i mean, every day i get just a little bit closer to..."
1,7,joey:," priesthood! look ross, i'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. if you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
1,7,ross:," i will, i will. see, i'm waiting for the right moment. what? what, now?"
1,7,joey:," yeeeeaaaahhh! what's messing you up? the wine? the candles? the moonlight? you've just got to go up to her and say, 'rachel, i think that...' "
1,7,ross:, shhhh!
1,7,rachel:, what are you shushing?
1,7,ross:, we're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. listen. don't you hear that?
1,7,rachel:, ahhhh!
1,7,ross:, see?
1,7,rachel:, huh. 
1,7,jill:, would you like some gum?
1,7,chandler:," um, is it sugarless?"
1,7,jill:," sorry, it's not."
1,7,chandler:," if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it. if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it. "
1,7,phoebe:," new york city has no power, and the milk is getting sour. but to me it is not scary, 'cause i stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... "
1,7,ross:," ok, here goes."
1,7,joey:, are you going to do it?
1,7,ross:, i'm going to do it.
1,7,joey:, do you want any help?
1,7,ross:," you come out there, you're a dead man."
1,7,joey:," good luck, man."
1,7,ross:, thanks. ok.
1,7,joey:, ok. 
1,7,joey:," hey, where are you going?"
1,7,monica:, outside.
1,7,joey:, you can't go out there.
1,7,monica:, why not?
1,7,joey:, because of... the reason.
1,7,monica:, and that would be?
1,7,joey:," i, um, can't tell you."
1,7,monica:," joey, what's going on?"
1,7,joey:," ok, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell ross that i told you."
1,7,monica:, about what?
1,7,joey:, he's planning your birthday party.
1,7,monica:, oh my god! i love him!
1,7,joey:, you'd better act surprised.
1,7,phoebe:, about what?
1,7,monica:, my surprise party!
1,7,phoebe:, what surprise party?
1,7,monica:, oh stop it. joey already told me.
1,7,phoebe:," well, he didn't tell me."

1,8,ross:," nono, she's gone."
1,8,monica:, we checked. a lot.
1,8,phoebe:," hm, i mean maybe no one ever really goes. ever since my mom died, every now and then, i get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? oh! and debbie, my best friend from junior high got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course i always get this really strong debbie vibe whenever i use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...i miss her."

1,9,ross:," thanks. yeah, carol borrowed it for a class, and i have to get it back to the museum."
1,9,susan:, what's it look like?
1,9,ross:, kinda like a big face without skin.
1,9,susan:," yes, i'm familiar with the concept. we can just look for it."
1,9,ross:," ok. wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
1,9,susan:," well, you know, you have to take a course. otherwise, they don't let you do it. "
1,9,ross:," hey, hey, yertle the turtle. a classic."
1,9,susan:," actually, i'm reading it to the baby."
1,9,ross:," the uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?"
1,9,susan:," what, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?"
1,9,ross:," you're not serious, i mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
1,9,susan:," yeah, all the time. i want the baby to know my voice."
1,9,ross:," do you uh, do you talk about me?"
1,9,susan:," yeah, yeah, all the time."
1,9,ross:, really?
1,9,susan:," but um, we just refer to you as bobo the sperm guy. "
1,9,ross:," look, if she's talking to it, i just think that i should get some belly time too. not that i believe any of this."
1,9,phoebe:," oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
1,9,chandler:," i'd just like to say that i'm totally behind this experiment. in fact, i'd very much like to butter your head. "
1,9,monica:," hey, rach, did you make your money?"
1,9,rachel:," no, not even close. forget vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
1,9,monica:," rach, here's your mail."
1,9,rachel:," thanks, you can just put it on the table."
1,9,monica:," no, here's your mail."
1,9,rachel:," thanks, you can just put it on the table."
1,9,monica:, would you just open it? 
1,9,rachel:," oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
1,9,monica:, we all chipped in.
1,9,joey:, we did?
1,9,monica:, you owe me 20 bucks.
1,9,rachel:, thank you. thank you so much!
1,9,monica:," chandler, here you go, got your traditional thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of funyuns."
1,9,rachel:," wait, wait, chandler, this is what you're havin' for thanksgiving dinner? what, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
1,9,chandler:," all right, i'm nine years old."
1,9,ross:," oh, i hate this story."
1,9,chandler:," we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have and i remember this part vividly a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
1,9,rachel:, oh my god.
1,9,chandler:, yes. it's very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. 
1,9,joey:," uh, hi. we uh, we used to work together."
1,9,girl:, we did?
1,9,joey:," yeah, at macy's. you were the obsession girl, right? i was the aramis guy. aramis? aramis? "
1,9,girl:," yeah, right."
1,9,joey:, i gotta tell you. you're the best in the business.
1,9,girl:, get out.
1,9,joey:," i'm serious. you're amazing. you know when to spritz, when to lay back."
1,9,girl:, really? you don't know what that means to me.
1,9,joey:," ooh, you smell great tonight. what're you wearing?"
1,9,girl:, nothing.
1,9,joey:," listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
1,9,girl:, yeah. oh.
1,9,joey:, what's wrong?
1,9,girl:," i just remembered, i have to do something."
1,9,joey:, oh. what?
1,9,girl:," um, leave."
1,9,joey:," wait, wait, wait! "
1,9,joey:, so i guess you all saw it.
1,9,rachel:, saw what?
1,9,phoebe:," no, we were just laughing. you know, how laughter can be infectious. "
1,9,joey:, set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd.
1,9,chandler:," tonight, on a very special blossom. commercial break "
1,9,monica:," mmm, looking good. ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. what?"
1,9,ross:, i don't know. it's just not the same without mom in the kitchen.
1,9,monica:," all right, that's it. you know what? just get out of my way and stop moping."
1,9,ross:, that's closer. 
1,9,rachel:," i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop."
1,9,chandler:," oh, you must stop shooping."
1,9,rachel:," ok, i'm gonna get my stuff."
1,9,joey:," chandler, will you just come in already?"
1,9,chandler:," no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. "
1,9,phoebe:," look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
1,9,chandler:," ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore. "
1,9,joey:," hey, monica, i got a question. i don't see any tater tots."
1,9,monica:, that's not a question.
1,9,joey:," but my mom always makes them. it's like a tradition. you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! it's bad enough i can't be with my family because of my disease."
1,9,monica:," all right, fine. tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots."
1,9,ross:," ok, i'm off to talk to my unborn child. "
1,9,monica:, ah!
1,9,ross:," ok, mom never hit. "
1,9,phoebe:," ok, all done."
1,9,monica:," what, phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? ross needs lumps!"
1,9,phoebe:," oh, i'm sorry, oh, i just, i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
1,9,monica:, why would we do that?
1,9,phoebe:," well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
1,9,monica:," ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
1,9,rachel:," ok, good bye you guys. thanks for everything. oh, sorry! oh, sorry! "
1,9,chandler:, the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away.
1,9,joey:, the balloon?
1,9,chandler:," no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it's all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park. i'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
1,9,rachel:," i can't, i gotta go."
1,9,chandler:, come on. an 80 foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen?
1,9,phoebe:, almost never.
1,9,monica:, got the keys? or got the keys!
1,9,rachel:, ok. 
1,9,carol:, anytime you're ready.
1,9,ross:," ok, ok, here we go. ok, where am i talking to, here? i mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
1,9,carol:, just aim for the bump.
1,9,ross:," ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. you know, i, you know, can't do this. uh, this is too weird. i feel stupid."
1,9,carol:," so don't do it, it's fine. you don't have to do it just because susan does it."
1,9,ross:," hello, baby. hello, hello. "
1,9,rachel:, i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
1,9,phoebe:," yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean."
1,9,monica:," ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. why are we standing here?"
1,9,rachel:, we're waiting for you to open the door. you got the keys.
1,9,monica:, no i don't.
1,9,rachel:," yes, you do. when we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
1,9,monica:," no i didn't. i asked, ""got the ke eys?"""
1,9,rachel:," no, no, no, you said, ""got the keys""."
1,9,chandler:, do either of you have the keys?
1,9,monica:, the oven is on.
1,9,rachel:," oh, i gotta get my ticket!"
1,9,joey:," wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
1,9,monica:," well then get it, get it!"
1,9,joey:, that tone will not make me go any faster.
1,9,monica:, joey!
1,9,joey:, that one will. 
1,9,ross:," and everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. so, on a dare, i picked paleontology. and you have no idea what i'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. you're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
1,9,carol:," look, you don't have to talk to it. you can sing to it if you want."
1,9,ross:," oh, please. i am not singing to your stomach, ok? "
1,9,susan:," hi, how's it goin?"
1,9,ross:," shh! here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. hey, hey! hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
1,9,carol:, i did.
1,9,ross:," does it always, uh ?"
1,9,carol:," no, no that was the first."
1,9,susan:, keep singing! keep singing!
1,9,ross:," hey, hey, you're my baby, and i can't wait to meet you. when you come out i'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
1,9,susan:, i felt it!
1,9,ross:," hey, hey, i'm your daddy. i'm the one without any breasts. "
1,9,joey:," nope, not that one."
1,9,monica:, can you go any faster with that?
1,9,joey:," hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. you do the math."
1,9,monica:, why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
1,9,chandler:, for an emergency just like this.
1,9,rachel:," all right, listen, smirky. if it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, i would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. but i'm not."
1,9,monica:, i swear you said you had the keys.
1,9,rachel:," no, i didn't. i wouldn't say i had the keys unless i had the keys, and i obviously didn't have the keys."
1,9,phoebe:," ooh, ok, that's it. enough with the keys. no one say keys. "
1,9,monica:, why would i have the keys?
1,9,rachel:, aside from the fact that you said you had them?
1,9,monica:, but i didn't.
1,9,rachel:," well, you should have."
1,9,monica:, why?
1,9,rachel:, because!
1,9,monica:, why?
1,9,rachel:, because!
1,9,monica:," why? because everything is my responsibility? isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner for everyone? you know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes. does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want? nooooo, no, no! just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions, and mario gets his tots, and it's my first thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and i... i..."
1,9,chandler:," ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go. "
1,9,monica:," well, the turkey's burnt. potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. "
1,9,ross:," here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like mom's."
1,9,monica:," no, it doesn't, does it? but you wanted lumps, ross? well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
1,9,rachel:," oh, god, this is great! the plane is gone, so it looks like i'm stuck here with you guys."
1,9,joey:," hey, we all had better plans. this was nobody's first choice."
1,9,monica:," oh, really? so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner?"
1,9,joey:, you call that delicious? 
1,9,monica:," stop it, stop it, stop it!"
1,9,chandler:, now this feels like thanksgiving. 
1,9,phoebe:, ooh. 
1,9,rachel:, what?
1,9,phoebe:, ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. oh my god. he's not alone. ugly naked guy's having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal. 
1,9,joey:, i've gotta see this. all right ugly naked guy!
1,9,monica:," ooh, ugly naked dancing!"
1,9,phoebe:, it's nice that he has someone. 
1,9,chandler:, shall i carve?
1,9,rachel:, by all means.
1,9,chandler:," ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
1,9,ross:, i don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
1,9,monica:, does anybody wanna split this with me?
1,9,joey:," oh, i will."
1,9,phoebe:," ooh, you guys have to make a wish."
1,9,monica:, make a wish?
1,9,phoebe:," come on, you know, thanksgiving. ooh, you got the bigger half. what'd you wish for?"
1,9,joey:, the bigger half.
1,9,chandler:," i'd like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked."
1,9,all:, that's so sweet.
1,9,ross:," and hey, here's to a lousy christmas."
1,9,rachel:, and a crappy new year.
1,9,chandler:," here, here! closing credits "

1,10,monica:," no, no, i don't."
1,10,rachel:," oh, he is precious! where did you get him?"
1,10,ross:, my friend bethel rescued him from some lab.
1,10,phoebe:, that is so cruel! why? why would a parent name their child bethel?
1,10,chandler:," hey, that monkey's got a ross on its ass!"
1,10,monica:," ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
1,10,ross:," yeah. i mean, it's been kinda quiet since carol left, so..."
1,10,monica:, why don't you just get a roommate?
1,10,ross:," nah, i dunno... i think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'. opening credits "
1,10,phoebe:," so you guys, i'm doing all new material tonight. i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."

1,10,monica:, so what are you gonna be?
1,10,joey:," ah, i'm gonna be one of his helpers. it's just such a slap in the face, y'know?"
1,10,rachel:," hey, do you guys know what you're doing for new year's? gee, what?! what is wrong with new year's?"
1,10,chandler:," desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! man, i'm talking loud!"
1,10,rachel:," well, for your information, paolo is gonna be in rome this new year, so i'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. "
1,10,phoebe:," yeah, you wish!"
1,10,chandler:," it's just that i'm sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday. i say this year, no dates, we make a pact. just the six of us dinner."
1,10,all:," yeah, okay. alright."
1,10,chandler:," y'know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. "

1,10,phoebe:," ...my mother's ashes even her eyelashes are resting in a little yellow jar, and sometimes when it's breezy... "
1,10,phoebe:," ...i feel a little sneezy and now i excuse me, excuse me! yeah, noisy boys! is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?"
1,10,max:," no. no, that's that's okay."
1,10,phoebe:," well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing, then i assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
1,10,chandler:, that guy's going home with a note!
1,10,david:, noth i was i was just saying to my 
1,10,phoebe:, could you speak up please?

1,10,max:, daryl hannah.
1,10,david:," daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and i said yeah, i liked her in splash, a lot, but not so much in in wall street, i thought she had kind of a "
1,10,max:, hard quality.
1,10,david:," hard quality. and uh, while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. then, uh, that that that's when you started yelling. "
1,10,phoebe:," okay, we're gonna take a short break. "
1,10,joey:," hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! "
1,10,ross:," come here, marcel. sit here. "

1,10,ross:, just a smidge.
1,10,phoebe:," david's like, y'know, scientist guy. he's very methodical."
1,10,monica:, i think it's romantic.
1,10,phoebe:, me too! oh! did you ever see an officer and a gentleman?
1,10,rachel:, yeah!
1,10,phoebe:," well, he's kinda like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... i just i just wanna be with him all the time. day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... "
1,10,chandler:," wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to new year's, aren't you. you're gonna break the pact. she's gonna break the pact."
1,10,phoebe:," no, no, no, no, no, no. yeah, could i just?"
1,10,chandler:," yeah, 'cause i already asked janice."
1,10,monica:, what?!
1,10,ross:," c'mon, this was a pact! this was your pact! "
1,10,chandler:," i snapped, okay? i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped."
1,10,monica:," yeah, but janice? that that was like the worst breakup in history!"
1,10,chandler:," i'm not saying it was a good idea, i'm saying i snapped! "
1,10,joey:," hi. hi, sorry i'm late. "
1,10,chandler:, too many jokes... must mock joey! 
1,10,joey:," nice shoes, huh? "

1,10,monica:, ross! he's playing with my spatulas again!
1,10,ross:," okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
1,10,monica:, do you always have to bring him here?
1,10,ross:," i didn't wanna leave him alone. alright? we we had our first fight this morning. i think it has to do with my working late. i said some things that i didn't mean, and he he threw some faeces..."
1,10,chandler:," y'know, if you're gonna work late, i could look in on him for you."
1,10,ross:," oh, that'd be great! okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
1,10,chandler:," okay, but if he asks, i'm not going to lie. "
1,10,david:," ...but, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions."
1,10,phoebe:," okay, alright, i have a question, then. "
1,10,david:, yuh.
1,10,phoebe:," um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
1,10,david:," uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. and, uh, the answer would be yes. yes i was. but, see, i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you."
1,10,phoebe:, sure.
1,10,david:," right. but, see, the longer i waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where i just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. and, uh, i'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella."
1,10,phoebe:," oh, david, i, i think you are a sweeping sorta fella. i mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
1,10,david:, rrrreally.
1,10,phoebe:," oh, yeah, oh, i'm sure of it. you should just do it, just sweep and throw me. "
1,10,david:, ...now? now?
1,10,phoebe:," oh yeah, right now."
1,10,david:," okay, okay, okay. y'know what, this was just really expensive. and i'll take this was a gift. "
1,10,phoebe:," okay, now you're just kinda tidying. "
1,10,david:," okay, what the hell, what the hell. you want me to actually throw you or you you wanna just hop?"
1,10,phoebe:, i can hop. 
1,10,ross:, so tell me something. what does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
1,10,monica:," i'm sorry, okay. it's just that chandler has somebody, and phoebe has somebody i thought i'd ask fun bobby."
1,10,chandler:, fun bobby? your ex boyfriend fun bobby?
1,10,monica:, yeah.

1,10,rachel:," oh, c'mon. we'll have, we'll have a big party, and no one'll know who's with who."
1,10,ross:," hey, y'know, this is so not what i needed right now."
1,10,monica:, what's the matter?
1,10,ross:," oh, it's it's marcel. he keeps shutting me out, y'know? he's walking around all the time dragging his hands... "
1,10,chandler:," that's so weird, i had such a blast with him the other night."

1,12,chandler:, you pick one.
1,12,joey:," all right, how about the ladybugs?"
1,12,chandler:," oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"

1,12,rachel:," all right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies i've ever had."
1,12,phoebe:, which proves that i never lie.

1,12,phoebe:, paolo made a pass at me. 
1,12,chandler:," so, what do you think?"
1,12,ross:, i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen.

1,12,monica:, we should get over there and see if she's okay. just one...second! score! game! come on. 
1,12,ross:," ah...ooh! well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."

1,12,ross:," come on, two on one."
1,12,chandler:," what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
1,12,ross:," what, now?"
1,12,joey:," yes, now is when you swoop! you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy rachel sees is you, she's gotta know that you're everything he's not! you're like, like the anti paolo!"
1,12,chandler:," my catholic friend is right. she's distraught. you're there for her. you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of ross! "
1,12,paolo:," no, that's cold, that's cold, that's... "
1,12,ross:, how's it going?
1,12,monica:," don't stare. now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm waving, , ok, that is either, ""how could you?"" or, ""enormous breasts!"" here he comes! "
1,12,phoebe:, ooh! 
1,12,paolo:," uh, i am, uh, to say good bye."
1,12,phoebe:," oh, ok bye bye."

1,12,paolo:, grazie.
1,12,ross:," paolo, i i just want to tell you and i think i speak for everyone when i say... "
1,12,phoebe:," oh, just look at her... "
1,12,ross:," oh you guys, i i really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed..."
1,12,monica:," oh, you're right."
1,12,ross:, ...and i really think it should be me. 
1,12,ross:, hey.

1,12,ross:," come here. listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, i mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you."
1,12,rachel:," oh, ross..."
1,12,ross:, what?
1,12,rachel:," i am so sick of guys. i don't want to look at another guy, i don't want to think about another guy, i don't even want to be near another guy. "

1,12,phoebe:, yep!
1,12,ross:," see, rach, uh, see, i don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. i really don't. i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process."
1,12,rachel:," no. i just need to be by myself for a while, you know? i just got to figure out what i want"
1,12,ross:," uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a paolo."

1,13,chandler:," whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what'd you mean by that?"
1,13,roger:," oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance."

1,13,joey:," of course, course one of 'em's ma. what's the matter with you. "
1,13,joey:," it's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. he's like actually some spy, working for the c.i.a. that'd be cool.... this blows!"
1,13,rachel:," i know, i mean, why can't parents just stay parents? why do they have to become people? why do they have... why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
1,13,chandler:, what? what?
1,13,rachel:, did you not get a good enough look the other day?
1,13,ross:," alright, alright. we're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
1,13,chandler:," y'know, i don't see that happening?"
1,13,rachel:," c'mon, he's right. tit for tat."
1,13,chandler:, well i'm not showing you my 'tat.' 
1,13,monica:, hello?
1,13,phoebe:, it's phoebe.
1,13,roger:, and rog.
1,13,monica:, c'mon up.
1,13,chandler:," oh, good. rog is here."
1,13,joey:, what's the matter with rog?
1,13,ross:, yeah.
1,13,chandler:," oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... i hate that guy."
1,13,ross:," what, so he was a little analytical. that's what he does, y'know? c'mon, he's not that bad. "
1,13,ross:," y'see, that's where you're wrong. why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
1,13,roger:, i dunno. maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
1,13,ross:, why? why would i why? why? why? why?
1,13,roger:," i don't know. maybe maybe low self esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you..."
1,13,monica:," wait wait, go back to that sibling thing."
1,13,roger:," well, i don't know. i mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents."
1,13,ross:, that that's ridiculous! i don't feel guilty for her failures!
1,13,monica:, oh! so you think i'm a failure!
1,13,phoebe:, isn't he good?
1,13,ross:," nonono, thatthat's not what i was saying..."
1,13,monica:," y'know, all these years, i thought you were on my side. but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
1,13,ross:," hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good! "
1,13,rachel:," you're right! i mean you're right! it wasn't just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace, and and the weebles' cruise ship. oh, which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in. "
1,13,roger:," that's tough. tough stuff. c'mon, pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going. "
1,13,phoebe:," oh, okay. feel better, rachel, 'kay?"
1,13,roger:," geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie..."
1,13,phoebe:," oh, okay. listen, thanks for everything, mon."
1,13,monica:, you're welcome.
1,13,roger:," listen guys, it was great seeing you again. mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? remember, they're just food, they're not love. "
1,13,monica:, hate that guy! 
1,13,joey:," night, you guys. "
1,13,chandler:," oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
1,13,joey:," hey. can, uh, can we help you?"
1,13,ronni:," oh, no thanks, i'm just waiting for, uh, joey tribbiani."
1,13,joey:, i'm joey tribbiani.
1,13,ronni:," oh no, not you, big joey. oh my god, you're so much cuter than your pictures! i i'm, i'm ronni....cheese nip?"
1,13,chandler:," uh, joey's having an embolism, but i'd go for a nip, y'know? commercial break "
1,13,ronni:," now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
1,13,chandler:," joey, if i go first, i wanna be looking for my keys."
1,13,ronni:," hey, joe."
1,13,joey:, huh?
1,13,ronni:," hey! hello, babe! wh what're what're you doing here?"
1,13,ronni:, thank you. uh...
1,13,chandler:," so, who's up for a big game of kerplunk?"
1,13,ronni:, i don't want you taking that thing.
1,13,ronni:," oh, where'm i gonna stay, here?"
1,13,joey:, we'll go to a hotel.
1,13,ronni:, we'll go to a hotel.
1,13,joey:, no you won't.
1,13,ronni:, no we won't.
1,13,joey:, you're gonna keep an eye on us?
1,13,joey:," that's right, mister, and i don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend."
1,13,ronni:, wow. he's strict.
1,13,joey:," now dad, you'll be in my room, ronni uh, you can stay in chandler's room."
1,13,ronni:," thanks. you're, uh, you're a good kid."
1,13,chandler:," c'mon, i'll show you to my room. ...that sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""no thanks, it's late."" "
1,13,joey:, what kinda change?
1,13,joey:, i can't do that!
1,13,joey:," yeah, but this is"
1,13,joey:, i don't wanna hear it! now go to my room! 
1,13,chandler:," hey, kicky. what're you doing?"
1,13,joey:, just trying to get comfortable. i can't sleep in my underwear. 
1,13,chandler:," well, you're gonna."
1,13,joey:," i've been thinking. y'know, about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
1,13,chandler:," are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
1,13,joey:," y'know what i mean, about how i'm always going out with all these women. and i always figured, when the right one comes along, i'd be able to be a stand up guy and go the distance, y'know? now i'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
1,13,chandler:," hey, you're not him. you're you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe fitting business, did you cave?"
1,13,joey:, no.
1,13,chandler:," no. you decided to go into the out of work actor business. now that wasn't easy, but you did it! and i'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""no thanks, i'm married."""
1,13,joey:, you really think so?
1,13,chandler:, yeah. i really do.
1,13,joey:," thanks, chandler. "
1,13,chandler:, get off! 
1,13,ronni:, hi.
1,13,monica:, hi...may i help you?
1,13,ronni:," yeah, uh, joey said i could use your shower, since, uh, chandler's in ours?"
1,13,monica:, okay...who are you?
1,13,ronni:," oh, i'm ronni. ronni rappelano? the mistress?"
1,13,monica:," oh, c'mon in."
1,13,ronni:, thanks.
1,13,rachel:," hi, i'm rachel."
1,13,ronni:, hi.
1,13,rachel:, bathroom's up there.
1,13,ronni:, great.
1,13,rachel:," hey, listen, ronni, how long would you say chandler's been in the shower?"
1,13,ronni:," oh, like, uh, five minutes?"
1,13,rachel:," hey. morning, dear. "
1,13,rachel:, chandler bing? it's time to see your thing. 
1,13,joey:, what's the matter with you?!
1,13,rachel:, i thought it was chandler!
1,13,chandler:, what? what?
1,13,rachel:, you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing!
1,13,chandler:," sorry, my my thing was in there with me. "
1,13,all:," hey, pheebs."
1,13,phoebe:, hey. 
1,13,monica:, how's it going?
1,13,phoebe:, good. oh oh! roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys. 
1,13,phoebe:, so what's going on?
1,13,monica:," nothing, um, it's just, um... it's roger. "
1,13,ross:," i dunno, there's just something about..."
1,13,chandler:, basically we just feel that he's...
1,13,rachel:, we hate that guy.
1,13,all:, yeah. hate him.
1,13,ross:," we're sorry, pheebs, we're sorry."
1,13,phoebe:," uh huh. okay. okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
1,13,all:," ...no, we hate him."
1,13,rachel:, we're sorry. 
1,13,joey:, i came to give you this and this. 
1,13,joey:," why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? things were fine the way they were! there's chicken in there, put it away. for god's sake, joey, really. "
1,13,joey:," of course i knew! what did you think? your father is no james bond. you should've heard some of his cover stories. ""i'm sleeping over at my accountant's,"" i mean, what is that? please!"
1,13,joey:," do you remember how your father used to be? always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. now he's happy! i mean, it's nice, he has a hobby."
1,13,joey:," me? i'm fine. look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like sting. and i'll tell you something else. ever since that poodle stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... i mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."
1,13,joey:," well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. i just want it the way it was."
1,13,joey:," i know you did, cookie. oh, i know you did. so tell me. did you see her?"
1,13,joey:, that's sweet. could i take her?
1,13,joey:, with this ring? no contest. 
1,13,roger:," what's wrong, sweetie?"
1,13,phoebe:," nothing, nothing."
1,13,roger:," aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. "
1,13,phoebe:," it's, i mean, it's nothing, i'm fine. it's my friends. they they have a liking problem with you. in that, um, they don't."
1,13,roger:, oh. they don't.
1,13,phoebe:, but they don't see all the wonderfulness that i see. they don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. they just think you're a little...
1,13,roger:, what?
1,13,phoebe:, intense and creepy. 
1,13,roger:, oh.
1,13,phoebe:," but i don't. me, phoebe."
1,13,roger:," well, i'm not i'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
1,13,phoebe:," you're not? see, that's why you're so great! "
1,13,roger:," actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. y'know, this kind of co dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, i'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'oh, define me! define me! love me, i need love!'. "
1,13,monica:," so you talked to your dad, huh."
1,13,joey:," yeah. he's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today."
1,13,rachel:, wow.
1,13,chandler:, things sure have changed here on waltons mountain.
1,13,ross:," so joey, you okay?"
1,13,joey:," yeah, i guess. it's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
1,13,rachel:," just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."
1,13,chandler:," if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty year old boys, or... i'll end up like my mom."
1,13,phoebe:, hey.
1,13,all:," hey, pheebs."
1,13,monica:, how's it going?
1,13,phoebe:," oh, okay, except i broke up with roger."
1,13,all:, awww.
1,13,phoebe:," yeah, right."
1,13,all:, aaawwwwww!!
1,13,rachel:, what happened?
1,13,phoebe:," i don't know, i mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways i think he is so right for me, it's just... i hate that guy! closing credits "
1,13,phoebe:," hey, joey. what's going on?"
1,13,joey:, rachel green. 
1,13,monica:, joey!! what the hell were you doing?!
1,13,joey:, sorry. wrong boobies. 
1,13,monica:," oh! ...hello, dear. "
1,14,joey:," i'm tellin' you ross, she wants you."
1,14,ross:, she barely knows me. we just live in the same building.
1,14,chandler:, any contact?
1,14,ross:, she lent me an egg once.
1,14,joey:, you're in!
1,14,ross:," aw, right."
1,14,woman:," hi, ross."
1,14,ross:, hey. 
1,14,chandler:," come on, ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex wife is a lesbiani don't think we need a third... "
1,14,joey:," excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? thanks."
1,14,ross:, an egg?
1,14,joey:," yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""here's your egg back, i'm returning your egg."""
1,14,chandler:, i think it's winning.
1,14,ross:, i think it's insane.
1,14,chandler:," she'll love it. go with the egg, my friend. "
1,14,joey:, think it'll work?
1,14,chandler:," no, it's suicide. the man's got an egg. opening credits "
1,14,monica:, you can not do this.
1,14,rachel:," do what, do what?"
1,14,monica:, roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
1,14,rachel:, no! phoebes! don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
1,14,phoebe:," 'cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on valentine's day!"
1,14,monica:," but phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. i know i do. "
1,14,rachel:," well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
1,14,joey:," actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
1,14,chandler:," oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
1,14,joey:," no, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. the only reason she's goin' out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend."
1,14,chandler:," yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
1,14,joey:," pathetic mess? i know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. i'm thinkin', cha ching! thanks. look, you have not been out with a woman since janice. you're doin' this."
1,14,ross:, hi. she said yes.
1,14,chandler:," yes! way to go, man! still got the egg, huh? "
1,14,joey:, how do i look?
1,14,chandler:," oh, uh, i... don't... care. ok, now, remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess."
1,14,lorraine:," hi, joey. well well, look what you brought. very nice."
1,14,chandler:, ...and what did you bring?
1,14,lorraine:," she's checking the coats. joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for janice."
1,14,chandler:, janice? 
1,14,janice:, oh.... my.... god.
1,14,chandler:," hey, it's janice. "
1,14,chandler:," ok, i'm makin' a break for it, i'm goin' out the window. "
1,14,joey:," no, no, no, don't! i've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with lorraine. just calm down. "
1,14,chandler:, calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that i've dumped twice in the last five months!
1,14,joey:," can you stop yellin'? you're makin' me nervous, and i can't go when i'm nervous."
1,14,chandler:," i'm sorry, i'm sorry, you're right. come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!! "
1,14,rachel:," ok, ok, roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to pete carney."
1,14,monica:, which one was pete carney?
1,14,rachel:," pete the weeper? remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. ""was it good for you?"""
1,14,monica:," yeah, well, i'll take a little crying any day over howard the ""i win"" guy. ""i win! i win!"" i went out with the guy for two monthsi didn't get to win once."
1,14,rachel:, how did we end up with these jerks? we're good people!
1,14,monica:, i don't know. maybe we're some kinda magnets.
1,14,phoebe:, i know i am. that's why i can't wear a digital watch.
1,14,monica:," there's more beer, right?"
1,14,phoebe:," oh! you know my friend abby who shaves her head? she said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
1,14,rachel:," pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
1,14,phoebe:," yeah. so, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. it's valentine's day. it's perfect."
1,14,monica:," ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
1,14,phoebe:," ok. we can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
1,14,rachel:, or?
1,14,phoebe:," or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
1,14,monica:, burning's good.
1,14,rachel:," burning's good. yeah, i got stuff to burn. "
1,14,lorraine:," you know, ever since i was little, i've been able to pick up quarters with my toes."
1,14,joey:," good for you. uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
1,14,janice:," by the way, chandler. i cut you out of all my pictures. so if you want, i have a bag with just your heads."
1,14,chandler:, that's ok.
1,14,janice:," oh, are you sure? really? because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. "
1,14,joey:, we can't do that.
1,14,chandler:, what? what can't you do?
1,14,joey:," uh, can i talk to you for a second, over there? "
1,14,joey:," uh, we might be leaving now."
1,14,chandler:," tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
1,14,joey:," she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. i'm not even sure what slathering is, but i definitely want to be a part of it."
1,14,chandler:," ok, you can not do this to me."
1,14,joey:," you're right, i'm sorry. you're right."
1,14,lorraine:," uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?"
1,14,joey:," i'm outta here. here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, chandler."
1,14,chandler:, i hope she throws up on you. 
1,14,chandler:, so...
1,14,janice:, just us.
1,14,chandler:," oh, what a crappy night!"
1,14,janice:," although, i have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. "
1,14,chandler:, excuse me. how ya doin'?
1,14,janice:," so, do we have the best friends or what?"
1,14,chandler:, joey's not a friend. he's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. another drink? some dessert? a big screen tv?
1,14,janice:, i will go for that drink.
1,14,chandler:, you got it. good woman! could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
1,14,janice:, each.
1,14,chandler:," that's right, each. oh, and a uh rob roy. i've always wanted to know... "
1,14,janice:, happy valentine's day! commercial break 
1,14,janice:," oh, i miss you already. can you believe this happened?"
1,14,chandler:," no... no! and yet it did. good bye, janice."
1,14,janice:, kiss me! (janice kisses him. monica comes out for the newspaper.}
1,14,monica:," oh, chandler, sorry. "
1,14,monica:," ohhh, chandler, sorry! hey, janice."
1,14,janice:," hi, monica."
1,14,chandler:," ok, well, this was very special."
1,14,monica:," rach, come see who's out here! "
1,14,rachel:," oh my god. janice, hi!"
1,14,chandler:, janice is gonna go away now.
1,14,monica:, i'll be right back. 
1,14,rachel:," oh, joey, look who it is."
1,14,joey:, whoa.
1,14,chandler:," oh, good, joey's home now."
1,14,janice:, this is so fun. this is like a reunion in the hall. 
1,14,monica:," oh, hi, ross. yeah. there's someone i want you to say hi to. he just happened to call."
1,14,janice:," hi, ross. yes, it's me. how did you know? "
1,14,ross:," i'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from new york to los angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half. "
1,14,kristin:, that's funny. who are they?
1,14,ross:," the blond woman is my ex wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
1,14,kristin:, you mean they're lovers.
1,14,ross:, if you wanna put a label on it.
1,14,kristin:," wow, uh, anything else i should know?"
1,14,ross:," nope, nope, that's it. "
1,14,ross:," oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. i always forget that part. helloo! "
1,14,phoebe:," ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
1,14,monica:," all i have is, is oregano and a fresca."
1,14,phoebe:," um, that's ok! ok. all right. now we need the semen of a righteous man."
1,14,rachel:," ok, pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
1,14,monica:, can we just start throwing things in?
1,14,phoebe:," ok, yeah, ok. oh, ok."
1,14,rachel:," ok, barry's letters. adam ritter's boxer shorts."
1,14,phoebe:," ok, and i have the, uh receipt for my dinner with nokululu oon ah ah."
1,14,monica:," look, here's a picture of scotty jared naked."
1,14,rachel:, hey he's wearing a sweater.
1,14,monica:, eww!
1,14,rachel:, and here we have the last of paulo's grappa.
1,14,monica:," hey, rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure... "
1,14,chandler:, how can i dump this woman on valentine's day?
1,14,joey:, i don't know. you dumped her on new year's.
1,14,chandler:," oh, man. in my next life, i'm coming back as a toilet brush. "
1,14,janice:," hello, funny valentine."
1,14,chandler:," hi, just janice."
1,14,janice:," hello, joey, our little matchmaker. i could just kiss you all over, and i'm gonna! "
1,14,joey:," if you don't do it, i will. "
1,14,ross:," so, um, what do you do for a living?"
1,14,kristin:," well, um, for the past few years i've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
1,14,carol:, oh no. i thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. 
1,14,susan:, i thought they could...i'll try to get back as soon as i can. i'm sorry. 
1,14,ross:," now that is funny. hey, do you think...would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us? 'cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. "
1,14,kristin:, i guess.
1,14,ross:, are you sure? great. carol? wanna come over and join us?
1,14,carol:," oh, no no no. i'm fine. i'm fine."
1,14,ross:," boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half charred picturewow, that guy's hairier than the chief!"
1,14,monica:, you're our third call tonight.
1,14,rachel:," oh, sure, valentine's is our busiest night of the year. "
1,14,janice:, i brought you something.

1,14,carol:," uh, i don't think she's in the bathroom. her coat is gone."
1,14,ross:, well maybe it's cold in there. or maybe i screwed up the first date i had in 9 years. 
1,14,carol:, that could be it.
1,14,ross:," oh, god. you know, this is still pretty hot. "
1,14,carol:," mushroom. smile. they won't all be like this. some women might even stay through dinner. sorry, that's not funny"

1,14,carol:, all you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set. 
1,14,carol:," we get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"

1,15,all:, why?
1,15,chandler:, why? this was supposed to be a temp job!
1,15,monica:," yeah, chandler... you've been there for five years."
1,15,chandler:," if i took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do."
1,15,phoebe:, so was it a lot more money?
1,15,chandler:, it doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the wenus. 
1,15,rachel:, ... the wenus?
1,15,chandler:, weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term.

1,15,chandler:, yeah... i just don't have that much cheffing experience. unless it's an all toast restaurant.
1,15,phoebe:," yeah, yeah! "
1,15,monica:," well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
1,15,phoebe:," well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu."
1,15,monica:, oh my god!
1,15,phoebe:," yeah, i know! so, what do you think?"
1,15,chandler:," thanks, phoebe. but i just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
1,15,phoebe:, ok. oh monica! guess what! 
1,15,chandler:, can you see my nipples through this shirt?
1,15,rachel:," no. but don't worry, i'm sure they're still there."

1,15,rachel:, the meeting with the guy went great?
1,15,monica:," so great! he showed me where the restaurant's going to be. it's this, it's this cute little place on 10th street. not too big, not too small. just right."
1,15,chandler:, was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
1,15,monica:," so anyway, i'm cooking dinner for him monday night. you know, kind of like an audition. and phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
1,15,rachel:, what are you going to make?

1,15,chandler:, who are you going out with?
1,15,phoebe:," oh, is this the bug lady?"
1,15,rachel:," bzzzz.... i love you, ross."
1,15,ross:, her name is celia. she's not a bug lady. she's curator of insects at the museum.
1,15,rachel:, so what are you guys going to do?
1,15,ross:," oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and i'd introduce her to my monkey."
1,15,chandler:, and he's not speaking metaphorically.
1,15,joey:," so.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh huh?"
1,15,ross:," well, i don't know.... huh huh.... but i'm hoping huh huh."
1,15,joey:," i'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! she's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal. "
1,15,ross:," celia, don't worry!  don't scream!  he's not going to hurt you! soothing tones, celia. soothing tones! marcel..."

1,15,joey:," i don't know. we're talking about whipped fish, monica. i'm just happy i'm keeping it down, y'know? "
1,15,rachel:, my god! what happened to you?
1,15,chandler:," eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do i learn? ""you are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
1,15,phoebe:, that's so great! 'cause you already know how to do that!
1,15,chandler:," can you believe it? i mean, don't i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? you know, i just always pictured myself doing something...something."
1,15,rachel:," oh chandler, i know, i know... oh, hey! you can see your nipples through this shirt!"
1,15,monica:," here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
1,15,chandler:," ooh, you know, i had a grape about five hours ago, so i'd better split this with you."
1,15,monica:, it's supposed to be that small. it's a pre appetizer. the french call it an amouz bouche.

1,16,nina:, maybe. but that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
1,16,chandler:," ah, well, maybe that's, ah, because you're getting a big raise."

1,19,luisa:," oookay. are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?"
1,19,phoebe:, oh my god. you'd put that poor little creature in jail?
1,19,monica:," pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?"

1,19,luisa:," ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. but you? what a bitch!"

1,20,rachel:," y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. he took me to lunch at the russian tea room, and i had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out..."
1,20,phoebe:, not a good day for birds...
1,20,rachel:," then we took a walk down to bendall's, and i told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of chanel..."
1,20,ross:," that's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
1,20,rachel:," right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? it was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
1,20,ross:," that's, that's nice twice!"
1,20,monica:," rachel, what's going on? i mean isn't this the same barry who you left at the altar?"
1,20,joey:," duh, where've you been?"
1,20,rachel:," yeah, but it was different with him today! and he wasn't, like, orthodontist guy, y'know? i mean, we had fun! is there anything wrong with that? "
1,20,chandler:, yes!
1,20,rachel:, why?
1,20,chandler:, i have my reasons.
1,20,monica:," okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex best friend?"
1,20,rachel:," all right. all right, all right, all right, all right, i know it's stupid! i will go see him this afternoon, and i will just put an end to it! "
1,20,rachel:, wow... wow!
1,20,barry:, yeah.
1,20,rachel:," i'm not crazy, right? i mean, it was never like that."
1,20,barry:," nooo, it wasn't."
1,20,rachel:," ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... "
1,20,chandler:," oh, danielle! i wasn't expecting the machine... give me a call when you get a chance. bye bye. oh god!"
1,20,monica:, that's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
1,20,chandler:," hey, i've been honing!"
1,20,ross:, what was with the dishes?
1,20,chandler:," oh, uh.. i want her to think i might be in a restaurant.. y'know? i might have some kind of life, like i haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
1,20,monica:," look look! he's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
1,20,phoebe:, oh my god! go away! stop looking in here!
1,20,monica:," great, now he's waving back."
1,20,joey:," man, we gotta do something about that guy. this morning, i caught him looking into our apartment. it creeps me out! i feel like i can't do stuff!"
1,20,monica:, what kinda stuff?
1,20,joey:," will you grow up? i'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when i'm cooking naked."
1,20,phoebe:, you cook naked?
1,20,joey:," yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. "
1,20,chandler:, what are you looking at me for? i didn't know that. 
1,20,barry:, what's the matter?
1,20,rachel:," oh, it's just... oh, barry, this was not good."
1,20,barry:," no, it was. it was very very good."
1,20,rachel:," well, what about mindy?"
1,20,barry:," oh, way, way better than mindy."
1,20,rachel:," no, not that, i mean, what about you and mindy?"
1,20,barry:," well, if you want, i'll justi'll just break it off with her."
1,20,rachel:," no. no no no no, no. i mean, don't do that. not, i mean not for me. "
1,20,bernice:," dr. farber, bobby rush is here for his adjustment."

1,20,rachel:," oh, barry..! come on, this is all way too.."
1,20,barry:," we can, we can go to aruba! when i went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. you would've liked it. "

1,20,bobby:," hey, dr. farber. "
1,20,barry:," all right miss green, everything looks fine... yep, i think we're starting to see some real progress here. "

1,20,bobby:," i'm twelve, i'm not stupid. "
1,20,chandler:, can i use your phone?
1,20,monica:," yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone. "
1,20,chandler:," yes, it's working! why isn't she calling me back?"
1,20,joey:, maybe she never got your message.
1,20,phoebe:," y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
1,20,chandler:, y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
1,20,ross:," ...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
1,20,chandler:," ah, you obviously saw my personal ad. "
1,20,phoebe:, how many beeps?
1,20,chandler:, she answered.
1,20,monica:," y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
1,20,chandler:," i'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now i'm needy and snubbed. god, i miss just being needy. "
1,20,all:, hey! hi!
1,20,phoebe:, how'd he take it?
1,20,rachel:," pretty well, actually... "
1,20,monica:," uh, rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?"

1,20,ross:," no! no no, it is nothing like me and carol!"
1,20,rachel:," please. if she said to you, ""ross, i want you on this couch, right here, right now,"" what would you say? "
1,20,chandler:," if it helps, i could slide over."
1,20,ross:," it's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! it's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi i gotta go."
1,20,phoebe:, where are you going?
1,20,ross:," i just have to go, all right? do i need a reason? huh? i mean i have things to do with my life, i have a jam packed schedule, and i am late for keeping up with it. okay? "

1,20,monica:, why don't you just take it with you?
1,20,chandler:," hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
1,20,monica:, why don't you just call her?
1,20,chandler:," i can't call her, i left a message! i have some pride."
1,20,monica:, do you?
1,20,chandler:," no! danielle, hi! it's, uh, it's chandler! i'm fine. uh, listen, i don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that i am, i accidentally shut off my phone. oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. okay. she's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. she's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."

1,20,mindy:," now, i know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... except for maybe laurie schaffer, who i don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....okay, i'm just gonna ask you this once, and i want a straight answer."
1,20,rachel:, okay.
1,20,mindy:, will you be my maid of honour?
1,20,rachel:, of course!
1,20,mindy:, oh that's so great!

1,20,mindy:, that's not all.
1,20,rachel:, oh sure it is!
1,20,mindy:," oh no, it isn't! no! i think barry is seeing someone in the city."
1,20,rachel:," um, what what would make you think that?"
1,20,mindy:," well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like chanel."
1,20,rachel:," really. mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when i was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
1,20,mindy:," oh god! you see, that's what i was afraid of!"
1,20,rachel:, what? what's what you were afraid of?
1,20,mindy:," okay, okay... when barry was engaged to you, he and i...kind of... had a little thing on the side."
1,20,rachel:, what?
1,20,mindy:," i know. i know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said ""don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to rachel,"" and now i feel so stupid."

1,20,barry:, both of you?
1,20,mindy:," basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you."
1,20,barry:," i'm sorry... i'm sorry, god, i am so sorry, i'm an idiot, i was weak, i couldn't help myself! whatever i did, i only did because i love you so much!"
1,20,rachel:," uh which one of us are you talking to there, barr?"
1,20,barry:," ....mindy. mindy, of course mindy, it was always mindy."
1,20,rachel:, even when we were having sex in that chair?

1,20,rachel:," what are you talking about?! mindy, the guy is the devil! he's satan in a smock!"
1,20,mindy:," look, i know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, i still really wanna be mrs. dr. barry farber, d.d.s."
1,20,rachel:, oh god. 
1,20,mindy:, i hope you can find some way to be happy for me. and i hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?

1,20,danielle:," well, i've been calling you, but it turns out i had your number wrong. and when i finally got the right one from information, there was no answer. so i thought i'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay."
1,20,chandler:," ...i'm, i'm okay."

1,20,chandler:," well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if i was okay? i mean,... how needy is that? "
1,21,joey:, how could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
1,21,monica:, i have no idea. but look how much they spent!
1,21,rachel:," monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought."
1,21,monica:, i know. it's just such reckless spending.
1,21,ross:," i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind."
1,21,chandler:," wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop."
1,21,monica:, that's me.
1,21,phoebe:," oh! the yuk! ross, he's doing it again! "
1,21,ross:," marcel, stop humping the lamp! stop humping! now marcel, come back come here, marcel "
1,21,rachel:," oh no, not in my room! i'll get him."
1,21,monica:," ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
1,21,ross:," what? it's, it's just a phase."
1,21,chandler:," well, that's what we said about joey..."
1,21,ross:, would you all relax? it's not that big a deal.
1,21,rachel:, stop it! marcel! bad monkey!

1,21,rachel:, you're not an artist.
1,21,monica:," yeah, well i might be if i had the supplies! i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't."
1,21,rachel:," oh, monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
1,21,monica:," oh really? okay, let's compare, shall we."
1,21,rachel:," oh, it's so late for 'shall we'..."
1,21,monica:, do i go horseback riding in the park? do i take classes at the new school?
1,21,rachel:, nooo...
1,21,monica:," this is so unfair! she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother. "
1,21,chandler:, how about joey... pepponi?
1,21,joey:," no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral."
1,21,chandler:, joey... switzerland? 
1,21,joey:," plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like i'm, i dunno, this big. which i'm not."
1,21,chandler:, joe...joe...joe...stalin?
1,21,joey:, stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar.
1,21,chandler:," well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
1,21,joey:," joe stalin. y'know, that's pretty good."
1,21,chandler:, might wanna try joseph. 
1,21,joey:, joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that!
1,21,chandler:," oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof. "

1,21,monica:," alright, great. thanks a lot. i'm going to tap class."
1,21,rachel:," what, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?"
1,21,monica:," this woman's got my life, i should get to see who she is."
1,21,rachel:," go to the post office! i'm sure her picture's up! ...okay, monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! i mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing."
1,21,phoebe:," this is madness. it's madness, i tell you, for the love of god, monica, don't do it!! ...thank you. "
1,21,monica:, what d'you think?

1,21,rachel:, which one do you think she is? 
1,21,teacher:, may i help you?
1,21,monica:," oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
1,21,teacher:, you don't observe a dance class. you dance a dance class. spare shoes are over there.
1,21,rachel:, what does she mean?
1,21,phoebe:," i think she means 'you dance a dance class'. oh, c'mon, c'mon. "
1,21,monica:," okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
1,21,teacher:, people! last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. let's not have that happen again!

1,21,chandler:," she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
1,21,ross:, she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase. apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
1,21,joey:, hey! he beat ya.
1,21,ross:," she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
1,21,chandler:, so what does this mean?
1,21,ross:, i'm gonna have to give him up. commercial break 
1,21,joey:," i can't believe it, ross. this sucks!"
1,21,chandler:," i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?"
1,21,ross:," i know. i know. i mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing i can't get off my leg."
1,21,joey:, isn't there any way you can keep him?
1,21,ross:," no, no. the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. i've just gotta get him into a zoo."
1,21,joey:, how do you get a monkey into a zoo?
1,21,chandler:," i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen."
1,21,ross:," well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility."
1,21,chandler:," yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo. "
1,21,phoebe:," hey. we found her, we found the girl."
1,21,chandler:, what?
1,21,joey:, did you call the cops?
1,21,rachel:, nope. we took her to lunch.
1,21,chandler:, ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.
1,21,ross:, what?! are you insane? this woman stole from you. she stole. she's a stealer.
1,21,monica:," y'know what? after you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. i mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit."
1,21,ross:," yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
1,21,chandler:, ...take off their hats!
1,21,phoebe:, popes in a volkswagen! ...i love that joke. 
1,21,rachel:, monana was very brave.
1,21,monica:," so once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts..."
1,21,monica:, ...they threw us out! i was thrown out of a hotel! me!
1,21,rachel:," oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a broadway show."
1,21,monica:," there's an open call for cats. i'm thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. whaddya say?"
1,21,monica:," well, that's just probably 'cause of your amish background."
1,21,monica:," well, you're pennsylvania dutch, right?"
1,21,monica:, i i used to be just like you. and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life. did you ever see dead poets' society?
1,21,monica:," i thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? what was that?! it's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. i walked out of there and i thought, 'now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back.' and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do."
1,21,monica:, wow. then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire. 
1,21,ross:," oh god. we didn't get into scranton. that was like our safety zoo. they take like dogs and cows. see? i don't know who this is harder on, me or him."
1,21,phoebe:, i'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
1,21,ross:," marcel! marcel! marcel, no! good boy. see, how can nobody want him?"
1,21,rachel:," oh, somebody will."
1,21,joey:, you know there already is a joseph stalin?
1,21,chandler:, you're kidding.
1,21,joey:, apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. you'd think you would've known that!
1,21,chandler:," y'know, you'd think i would've."
1,21,joey:, phoebe. whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
1,21,phoebe:, ...flame boy. 
1,21,ross:," well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, marcel?"
1,21,ross:," does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
1,21,ross:, even if he were... cornered?
1,21,ross:," uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
1,21,ross:," how about a hammer, or a small blade?"
1,21,ross:," he he he got in, he he got in to san diego."
1,21,joey:," we, we come back from our walk and the the phone was ringing..."
1,21,chandler:, ...he's in.
1,21,ross:," you're making a big mistake here. i mean, san diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, i'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. "
1,21,monica:, yo hooo!
1,21,rachel:, where the hell've you been?

1,21,monica:," no, it is me! y'know, i'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! y'know, when i'm with her, i am so much more than that. i'm i'm monana! "
1,21,rachel:," hello? yes, she is, hold on a second, please. monana, it's for you, the credit card people."

1,21,monica:," monica, i started my day by peeing in front of twenty five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the big apple circus?"
1,21,monica:," there's nothing to wonder about, monica. you're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
1,21,monica:," yes necessarily! i mean, i dunno what it is, maybe it's the amish thing."
1,21,monica:, really? then why are you like that? 
1,21,teacher:, you by the door. in or out?
1,21,monica:, in. 
1,21,teacher:," you in the back, you're getting it all wrong!"

1,23,ross:," i don't know, but when i spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug. "
1,23,joey:, do we have to know about that?
1,23,monica:," joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
1,23,joey:," i'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
1,23,chandler:," yes, joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
1,23,ross:," god, i don't believe this. she could be giving birth in the cab."
1,23,rachel:," oh, ross, relax. it's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction. "
1,23,rachel:," what, it's ok when chandler does it?"
1,23,chandler:, you have to pick your moments. 
1,23,phoebe:," did i miss it, did i miss it?"

1,23,carol:," oh, i love them. each one's like a little party in my uterus."

1,23,chandler:," all right. i'll tell you what. when we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?"
1,23,monica:, why won't i be married when i'm 40?
1,23,chandler:," oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically."
1,23,monica:," ok, hypothetically, why won't i be married when i'm 40?"
1,23,chandler:," no, no, no."
1,23,monica:, what is it? is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?

1,23,lydia:, she's not much of a phone person.
1,23,joey:," yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, i mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, i'd wanna know about it, you know?"

1,23,carol:, count faster.
1,23,susan:," it's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for jordie. just keep focusing on jordie."
1,23,ross:, who the hell is jordie?
1,23,susan:, your son.
1,23,ross:," no no no. i don't have a son named jordie. we all agreed, my son's name is jamie."
1,23,carol:," well, jamie was the name of susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to jordie."

1,23,ross:, please. this is so your fault.
1,23,susan:," how, how is this my fault?"
1,23,ross:," look, carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
1,23,susan:," yeah? well, there's a lot of things carol never did before i came along."
1,23,ross:, you tryin' to be clever? a funny lady?
1,23,susan:, you know what your problem is? you're threatened by me.
1,23,ross:," oh, i'm threatened by you?"
1,23,susan:, yes. 
1,23,phoebe:," hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! get in here. come on. my god, you guys, i don't believe you. there are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. so just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
1,23,ross:," yeah, susan."
1,23,phoebe:," don't make me do this again, i don't like my voice like this. "
1,23,phoebe:," ok, who wants to hear something ironic? commercial break "

1,23,rachel:," no, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
1,23,carol:, ok.
1,23,rachel:, ok?
1,23,carol:, ok.
1,23,rachel:," it really was. there was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. there you go, dear. "
1,23,joey:," come on, lydia, you can do it. push! push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. let's i was justyeah, right. push! push! "
1,23,susan:," what're you gonna do, suck the door open?"
1,23,ross:, help! help!
1,23,phoebe:, help! 
1,23,monica:," now, mom, everything's going fine, really. yeah, ross is great. he's uh, he's in a whole other place. no, he's gone. no no, you don't have to fly back, really. what do you mean this might be your only chance? would you stop? i'm only 26, i'm not even thinking about babies yet. "
1,23,chandler:, where have you been?
1,23,joey:," oh, just had a baby."
1,23,chandler:," i don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. so, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
1,23,rachel:," no, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
1,23,rachel:," no, no, really. i suppose it's because i spend so much time, you know, where i do."
1,23,rachel:," i try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what i do. it's like uh...well, for instance, what do you do?"
1,23,rachel:," ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if i see one more cup of coffee'..."
1,23,rachel:, i'm gonna go check up on your friend.
1,23,rachel:, ok. that's fine. 
1,23,lydia:, so how did you know i was even here?
1,23,guy:, your mom called me. so is this her?
1,23,lydia:," no, this is a loaner."
1,23,guy:, i'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
1,23,lydia:," i wasn't by myself. i had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. so, did you see who won the game?"
1,23,guy:," yeah, the knicks by 10. they suck."
1,23,lydia:," yeah, they're not so bad. "
1,23,ross:," come on, come on. damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. this is all your fault. this is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? my son is being born, and i should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
1,23,susan:, the woman i love is having a baby today. i've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
1,23,ross:," no no no, believe me. no one has been waiting for this as much as i have, ok? and you know what the funny thing is? when this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? where does that leave me?"
1,23,susan:," you get to be the baby's father. everyone knows who you are. who am i? there's mother's day, there's father's day, there's no... lesbian lover day."
1,23,ross:, every day is lesbian lover day.
1,23,phoebe:, this is so great.
1,23,ross:, you wanna explain that?
1,23,phoebe:," i mean, well, 'cause when i was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. and here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. and it's not even born yet. it's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. i'm sorry, you were fighting. "
1,23,carol:, where are they?
1,23,monica:, i'm sure they'll be here soon.
1,23,rachel:," yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
1,23,joey:, relax. you're only at nine centimeters. and the baby's at zero station.
1,23,chandler:, you are really frightening me. 
1,23,chandler:," all right, ten centimeters, here we go."
1,23,nurse:," all right, honey, time to start pushing."
1,23,carol:," i'm sorry, i can't tell the baby to wait for them."
1,23,carol:," oh, god. "
1,23,ross:," ok, got the vent open."
1,23,phoebe:," hi, i'm ben. i'm hospital worker ben. it's ben... to the rescue!"
1,23,ross:," ben, you ready? all right, gimme your foot. ok, on three, ben. one, two, three. ok, that's it, ben. "
1,23,susan:, what do you see?
1,23,phoebe:," well, susan, i see what appears to be a dark vent. wait. yes, it is in fact a dark vent. "
1,23,ross:," phoebs, it's open! it's open! "
1,23,janitor:, wait! you forgot your legs! 
1,23,all:," push, push!"
1,23,ross:, we're here!
1,23,carol:, where have you been?
1,23,ross:," all right, carol, i need you to keep pushing. i need excuse me, could i have this?"
1,23,nurse:," all right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!"
1,23,all:, good luck! 
1,23,chandler:," let me ask you, do you have to be carol's lesbian life partner?"
1,23,nurse:," all right, he's crowning. here he comes."
1,23,ross:," let me see, i gotta see, i gotta see. oh, a head. oh, it's, it's huge. carol, how are you doing this?"
1,23,carol:," you're doing great, you're doing fine. "
1,23,ross:," hello! oh, sorry."
1,23,susan:, what do you see? what do you see?
1,23,ross:," we got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. it's a boy, definitely a boy! all right! ok, legs, knees, and feet. oh, oh. he's here. he's a person."
1,23,susan:," oh, look at that."
1,23,carol:, what does he look like?
1,23,ross:," kinda like my uncle ed, covered in jell o."
1,23,carol:, really?
1,23,phoebe:," you guys, he's beautiful!"
1,23,ross:," oh, thanks, pheebs! "
1,23,susan:," no shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy."

1,24,ross:," no no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. do you guys know who carl is?"
1,24,chandler:," uh, let's see... alvin... simon... theodore.... no."
1,24,ross:," well, rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
1,24,joey:, oh no! how can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
1,24,chandler:, forget about her.
1,24,joey:," he's right, man. please. move on. go to china. eat chinese food."
1,24,chandler:," course there, they just call it food."
1,24,ross:," yeah... i guess. i don'ti don't know. alright, just... just give her this for me, ok? "
1,24,joey:," listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
1,24,ross:, i know.
1,24,joey:," we want you to be happy. and i may only have a couple beers in me, but... i love you, man. "
1,24,chandler:, i'm still on my first. i just think you're nice. 
1,24,melanie:," anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. we call ourselves 'the three basketeers.'"
1,24,joey:," like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
1,24,chandler:, ooooh. 
1,24,monica:," ok, how does everybody like their burgers?"
1,24,rachel:," oh, no, no, no. presents first. food later. "
1,24,monica:," hey, hold on there, tiger. how's it going? how you holding up?"
1,24,joey:," well, not so good. she definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what i... "
1,24,joey:," then you do. heh, heh."
1,24,monica:," so, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
1,24,joey:, what do you mean?
1,24,monica:," y'know, just be there for her. "
1,24,joey:, not following you.
1,24,monica:, think about it. 
1,24,rachel:," ok, i'm guessing this is from... "
1,24,rachel:," well, thank you, melanie."
1,24,chandler:," ok, this one right here is from me."
1,24,rachel:," ok... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... travel scrabble! oooohhh, thank you! "
1,24,rachel:, this one's from joey... feels like a book. thinks it's a book... feels like a book. and... ...it's a book!
1,24,phoebe:," oh, it's dr. seuss!"
1,24,joey:, that book got me through some tough times.
1,24,melanie:, there is a little child inside this man!
1,24,chandler:," yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. "
1,24,rachel:, who's this from?
1,24,chandler:," oh, that's ross's. "
1,24,rachel:, oh... ... oh my god. he remembered.
1,24,phoebe:, remembered what?
1,24,rachel:," it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can't believe he remembered!"
1,24,chandler:," well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? "
1,24,phoebe:," oh, it's so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune."
1,24,monica:, i can't believe he did this.
1,24,chandler:," come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? "
1,24,rachel:, what did you just say?
1,24,chandler:, ahem... um... crystal duck.
1,24,rachel:," no, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
1,24,chandler:, f hah.... flennin....
1,24,rachel:, oh.... my god.
1,24,chandler:," oh, no no no no no...."
1,24,joey:," that's good, just keep rubbing your head. that'll turn back time. commercial break "
1,24,rachel:," i mean, this is unbelievable."
1,24,phoebe:," i know. this is really, really huge."
1,24,chandler:, no it's not. it's small. it's tiny. it's petite. it's wee.
1,24,phoebe:, nuh uh. i don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
1,24,chandler:," ok, is there a mute button on this woman?"
1,24,monica:," i think this is so great! i mean, you and ross! d did you have any idea?"
1,24,rachel:," w well, what else did he say? i mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
1,24,joey:," well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
1,24,rachel:," ross? all this time? well, i've got to talk to him. "
1,24,chandler:, h he's in china!
1,24,joey:, the country.
1,24,monica:," no, no, wait. his flight doesn't leave for another forty five more minutes."
1,24,chandler:, what about the time difference?
1,24,monica:, from here to the airport?
1,24,chandler:, yes! you're never gonna make it!
1,24,monica:," rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
1,24,rachel:, i i i don't know.
1,24,chandler:, well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
1,24,joey:," he's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
1,24,monica:," yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
1,24,rachel:, i don't know. maybe i'll know when i see him.
1,24,phoebe:," here, look, alright, does this help? "
1,24,rachel:," noooo... look, all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him. i mean, this is just too big. y'know, i just, i've just gotta talk to him. i... i gotta... ok, i'll see you later. "
1,24,chandler:," rachel, i love you! deal with me first! "
1,24,ross:, alright!
1,24,ross:, ni chou chi ma! 
1,24,rachel:, hi!
1,24,rachel:, may i see your boarding pass?
1,24,rachel:," oh, oooh. i'm sorry. you are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass."
1,24,rachel:, no no no! federal regulations!
1,24,rachel:, alright. what's the message?
1,24,rachel:," sir? sir? excuse me, sir? uh... i have a message for you."
1,24,man:," it's from rachel. she said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back."
1,24,man:," toby... oh, for god's sake, i don't know what she's talking about! there's no rachel! don't give me that deep freeze. "
1,24,melanie:," mmmmmm... oh, joey, joey, joey... i think i blacked out there for a minute!"
1,24,joey:," heh, heh. it was nothin'."
1,24,melanie:," well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! "
1,24,joey:," uhhh.. y'know what? forget about me. let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
1,24,melanie:, m me again?
1,24,joey:, sure! why not?
1,24,melanie:," boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow. "
1,24,melanie:," oooh, i gotta tell you... you are nothing like i thought you would be."
1,24,joey:, how do you mean?
1,24,melanie:," i don't know, i i guess i just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' but you... you're a giver. you're like the most generous man i ever met. i mean... you're practically a woman. "
1,24,monica:," uh, so, uh, rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, i mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with ross or should i just throw it out?"
1,24,rachel:, sure.
1,24,rachel:," i don't know, i mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but i'm thinking... oh, i'm thinking it'd be really great."
1,24,monica:," oh my god, me too! oh! oh, we'd be like friends in law! y'know what the best part is? the best part is that you already know everything about him! i mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!"
1,24,phoebe:," yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date."
1,24,monica:, another good point.
1,24,phoebe:," no, i mean, i mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. y'know, it's... you're committed."
1,24,rachel:, huh?
1,24,phoebe:," well, i mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
1,24,monica:, why isn't it working out?
1,24,rachel:, i don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
1,24,monica:, is he not cute enough for you?
1,24,rachel:, no!
1,24,monica:, does he not make enough money?
1,24,rachel:," no, i'm just...."
1,24,phoebe:, maybe there's someone else.
1,24,rachel:, wha...
1,24,monica:, is there? is there someone else?
1,24,rachel:, no! there is.. there is noone else!
1,24,monica:, then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? 
1,24,chandler:," hey, big..."
1,24,joey:, shhhh!
1,24,chandler:, ...spender.
1,24,joey:, she's still asleep.
1,24,chandler:, so how'd it go?
1,24,joey:," oh, it was amazing. you know how you always think you're great in bed?"
1,24,chandler:, the fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
1,24,joey:," well, it's like, last night, i couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. so i had to do all this other stuff. and the response i got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
1,24,chandler:," yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
1,24,joey:," it was amazing! and not just for her... uh uh. for me, too. it's like, all of a sudden, i'm blind. but all my other senses are heightened, y'know? it's like... i was able to appreciate it on another level."
1,24,chandler:, i didn't know you had another level.
1,24,joey:, i know! neither did i! 
1,24,monica:," hey, great skirt! birthday present?"
1,24,rachel:, yeah.
1,24,monica:," oh, from who?"
1,24,rachel:, from you. i exchanged the blouse you got me.
1,24,monica:," well, it's the thought. hey, doesn't ross's flight get in in a couple hours? at gate 27 b?"
1,24,rachel:," uh, yeah. uh, monica, y'know, honey, i've been thinking about it and i've decided thisthis whole ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
1,24,monica:," oh, why?"
1,24,rachel:," because, i feel like i wouldn't just be going out with him. i would be going out with all of you. oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and i don't wanna..."
1,24,monica:," no, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
1,24,rachel:," monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
1,24,monica:," i am not 'so'! ok, i was a teensy bit weird at first, but... i'll be good. i promise. "
1,24,rachel:, who is it?
1,24,intercom:," it's me, carl."
1,24,rachel:, c'mon up.
1,24,monica:, behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. 
1,24,joey:, seven hundred bucks!
1,24,chandler:," alright, you did it! do we have any fruit?"
1,24,joey:," man, hell of a two weeks, huh? y'know what, though? i really feel like i learned something."
1,24,chandler:," really? so, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
1,24,joey:," what, are you crazy? when a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? "
1,24,carl:," i'm just sayin', if i see one more picture of ed begley, jr. in that stupid electric car, i'm gonna shoot myself! i mean, don't get me wrong... i'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy! "
1,24,ross:, i can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
1,24,rachel:," would you excuse me, please? i'm trying to have a date here."
1,24,ross:," fine, just stop thinking about me. "
1,24,ross:," can't do it, can you?"
1,24,rachel:, so i'm thinking about you. so what?
1,24,ross:," i don't get it. what do you see in this guy, anyway?"
1,24,rachel:, well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
1,24,carl:," i mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!"
1,24,ross:," rachel, come on. give us a chance."
1,24,rachel:," ross, it's too hard."
1,24,ross:," no, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? who cares about them. this is about us. look, i i've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. "
1,24,rachel:," ross, you're like my best friend."
1,24,ross:, i know.
1,24,rachel:," if we broke up, and i lost you..."
1,24,ross:," whoa, whoa, whoa. what makes you think we're gonna break up?"
1,24,rachel:," well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
1,24,ross:," no. but... it only has to happen once. look, you and i both know we are perfect for each other, right? i mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?"
1,24,rachel:," i don't know... i mean, i've never looked at you that way before."
1,24,ross:," well, start looking. "
1,24,rachel:, wow.
1,24,carl:, exactly! and you just know i'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
1,24,rachel:, right! you're right!
1,24,carl:, heh... y'know?
1,24,rachel:, you know what?
1,24,carl:, what?
1,24,rachel:," i forgot... i am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. i am so sorry! i'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... i meani'm sorry. i i i gotta go. i'm sorry. "
1,24,carl:, but... 
1,24,rachel:," excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. hi. "
1,24,man:," for god's sake, will you let it go? there's no rachel! "
1,24,ross:," oh, hey, hey, i got that. "
1,24,julie:," oh, thanks, sweetie."
1,24,ross:, no problem. i cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
1,24,julie:, really?
1,24,ross:, yeah. 
1,24,julie:, you don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
1,24,ross:, can't wait.
1,24,ross:," come on, they're gonna love you. "
2,1,phoebe:," ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. ross was in love with rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and italian guys. finally chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when ross was in china on his dig, chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel. she was like, ""oh my god."" so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that ross was getting off the plane with another woman. uh oh! so, that's pretty much everything you need to know. but, enough about us. so, how've you been? opening credits "
2,1,rachel:, oh my god. oh my god. excuse me. move! move! emergency! excuse me! 
2,1,ross:, rach!
2,1,rachel:," oh, there you are! hi! oh, so, so, how was china, you? "
2,1,ross:," it was, it was great. oh, what happened?"
2,1,rachel:, what?
2,1,ross:, you're bleeding. 
2,1,rachel:," i am? oh, look at that, yes i am. enough about me, enough about me, mr. back from the orient. come on. i wanna hear everything! everything. "
2,1,ross:," well, where do i start? this is julie. julie, this is rachel."
2,1,rachel:," these are, these aren't for you. these are for you. welcome to our country."
2,1,julie:, thank you. i'm from new york.
2,1,rachel:," ok, well, not a problem. we'll just use them to stop the bleeding. ok. baggage claim? ok. "
2,1,chandler:,  no way!
2,1,monica:," i'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with ross! "
2,1,phoebe:," oh my god. this is huge. this is bigger than huge. this is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?"
2,1,joey:," um, this?"
2,1,phoebe:, yes.
2,1,monica:," guys, you got your hair cut."
2,1,chandler:," yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay."
2,1,phoebe:," 'cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. i love that voice."
2,1,rachel:," airport, airport. ross, not alone, julie, arm around her. cramp, cramp."
2,1,chandler:," ok, i think she's trying to tell us something. quick, get the verbs. "
2,1,rachel:," you, you, you said he liked me. you, you slowpokes!"
2,1,ross:," that's all right, rach, we got the bags. hi, hello. julie, this is my sister monica. this is chandler.  phoebe.  joey, what up?"
2,1,joey:, what up?!
2,1,ross:," everyone, this is julie."
2,1,rachel:, julie.
2,1,all:, ohh. hi!
2,1,julie:," hi, but i'm not here, you haven't met me. i'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when i don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me."
2,1,ross:, and bus.
2,1,julie:, oh my god.
2,1,ross:,  the screaming guy?
2,1,julie:,  and the spitting?
2,1,ross:, you gotta hear this story.
2,1,julie:," we're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old..."
2,1,ross:, 200 at least.
2,1,julie:,  ...and this guy...
2,1,rachel:," and the chicken pooped in her lap. oh, i'm so sorry. i just gave away the ending, didn't i? oh! it's just, i just heard this story in the cab, and it is all i can think about."
2,1,monica:," this is amazing. i mean, how, how did this happen?"
2,1,julie:," well, ross and i were in grad school together."
2,1,ross:," but we haven't seen each other since then. well i land in china, guess who's in charge of the dig. "
2,1,rachel:," julie! julie, isn't that great? i mean, isn't that just kick you in the crotch, spit on your neck fantastic?"
2,1,monica:, it's an expression.
2,1,ross:," well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby."
2,1,julie:, and then we've gotta get some sleep.
2,1,ross:," yeah, it's really 6 tomorrow night our time."
2,1,chandler:," well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause i like to be surprised. "
2,1,rachel:, bye. 
2,1,ross:," hey, rach, can i get some coffee?"
2,1,rachel:," yeah, sure."
2,1,ross:, thank you.
2,1,chandler:," hey, rach, can i get..."
2,1,rachel:, did you talk to him?
2,1,chandler:, not yet.
2,1,rachel:," then, no. "
2,1,chandler:," so what the hell happened to you in china? i mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
2,1,ross:," i know, i know i was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. you know whose voice that was?"
2,1,chandler:, god?
2,1,ross:," it was you, pal."
2,1,chandler:," well, maybe it was god, doing me."
2,1,ross:," look, you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. but then i met julie, and i don't know, we're havin' a great time. and i have to say, i never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
2,1,chandler:," well, you owe me one, big guy."
2,1,rachel:, here's your lemonade.
2,1,ross:, i didn't order lemonade.
2,1,rachel:," oh. well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. "
2,1,ross:, but...
2,1,rachel:," go go go go, come on! so uh, what did you find out?"
2,1,chandler:," he said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. i'm sorry. but, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  without any outside help whatsoever."
2,1,rachel:, how is that the silver lining?
2,1,chandler:, you have to really wanna see it. 
2,1,ross:," ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. "
2,1,monica:," pheebes, you know what i'm thinking?"
2,1,phoebe:," oh, ok. how, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?"
2,1,monica:," no, although now that's what i'm thinking."
2,1,phoebe:," all right, so what were you thinking?"
2,1,monica:," well, i was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, i thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
2,1,phoebe:, ohh! no.
2,1,monica:, why not?
2,1,phoebe:," because, i'm just, i'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak."
2,1,monica:, no you're not.
2,1,phoebe:," i know i'm not, but you are, and i was trying to spare your feelings. "
2,1,joey:," hello? oh, hi. yeah, hold on a second. ross, it's julie, for you. "
2,1,ross:, hello? hi.
2,1,chandler:, hi. anybody know a good tailor?
2,1,joey:, needs some clothes altered?
2,1,chandler:," no, no, i'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."

2,1,ross:," ok, ok, sweetheart, i'll see you later. ok, bye. what? oh, that is so sweet. no, no, ok, you hang up. ok, ok, one, two, three. well you didn't hang up either. "
2,1,rachel:, she didn't hang up either!
2,1,ross:," ok, no, no, you hang up. you, you, y..."
2,1,rachel:," sorry, i thought you were talking to me."
2,1,ross:, rachel! i'll just call her back. 
2,1,rachel:, okay!
2,1,ross:," hi?  sorry, we got disconnected... "
2,1,rachel:," ok, ok, ok. how did this happen to me? how did this happen to me? a week ago, two weeks ago, i was fine. ross was just ross, just this guy. now he's rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that i can't have."
2,1,monica:," sweetie, i wanted you to have him too."
2,1,rachel:," i know you did. i'm just gonna deal with it, i'm just gonna deal with it. i gotta get out of here. "
2,1,chandler:," ok, i don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her. "
2,1,joey:," you know, i think i was sixteen."
2,1,monica:," please, just a little bit off the back."
2,1,phoebe:," i'm still on ""no."""
2,1,rachel:," uh, morning. do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?"
2,1,joey:," no no no no no, i'm not fallin' for that again."
2,1,phoebe:, what's goin' on?
2,1,rachel:," well, i sorta did a stupid thing last night."
2,1,chandler:, what stupid thing did you do?
2,1,paulo:, bon giorno tutti!
2,1,phoebe:, ewww! commercial break 
2,1,rachel:," ok, paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye bye. "
2,1,monica:," rachel, how did this happen?"
2,1,rachel:," i don't know, i just kinda ran into him last night."
2,1,phoebe:, where?
2,1,rachel:, at his apartment. is this juice?
2,1,joey:," whoa, whoa. and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe?"
2,1,rachel:," oh god, i know i'm a pathetic loser."
2,1,monica:," honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
2,1,chandler:, people do stupid things when they're upset.
2,1,monica:," my god, if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn't... , but this is about your horrible mistake. "
2,1,all:, hi!
2,1,ross:," hi. sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching."
2,1,paulo:," hey, hey ross."

2,1,paulo:, i do raquel.
2,1,ross:," so, uh, he's back."
2,1,rachel:," yeah, he's back. is that a problem?"
2,1,ross:," no, not a problem."
2,1,rachel:, good! i'm glad it's not a problem.
2,1,phoebe:," ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
2,1,chandler:," well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, i've got pants that need to be altered."
2,1,joey:," hey, chandler, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello. he'll know what it means."
2,1,chandler:, are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
2,1,monica:," you know it's funny, the last time paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter."
2,1,phoebe:," all right. ok, but, but!  you have to promise that you will not be all like control y and bossy and monica about it."
2,1,monica:, i promise.
2,1,phoebe:," all right. now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing. "
2,1,phoebe:," all right, that's it, i quit."
2,1,monica:, what? i didn't say anything.
2,1,phoebe:," yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
2,1,monica:," i'm sorry. i'm sorry, phoebe. it's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
2,1,phoebe:, would you relax? i know what i am doing. this is how he wears it.
2,1,monica:, how who wears it?
2,1,phoebe:, demi moore.
2,1,monica:, demi moore is not a he.
2,1,phoebe:," well, he was a he in arthur, and in ten."

2,1,monica:," she's the actress that was in disclosure, indecent proposal, ghost!"
2,1,phoebe:," oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
2,1,monica:, i know! 
2,1,frankie:, how long do you want the cuffs?
2,1,chandler:, at least as long as i have the pants. 
2,1,frankie:," i just got that. ok, now we'll do your inseam. "
2,1,rachel:, how is she?
2,1,phoebe:," it's too soon to tell. she's resting, which is a good sign."
2,1,ross:, how's the hair?
2,1,phoebe:," i'm not gonna lie to you, ross, it doesn't look good. i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
2,1,joey:, can we see her?
2,1,phoebe:," your hair looks too good, i think it would upset her. ross, why don't you come on in. "
2,1,ross:,  yeah. 
2,1,joey:, how're you doing?
2,1,rachel:, i'm okay.
2,1,joey:," ooh, that bad, huh? "
2,1,rachel:, what?
2,1,joey:," look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. it's one of my gifts."
2,1,rachel:," when i saw him get off that plane with her, i really thought i hit rock bottom. but today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me."
2,1,joey:, you gotta tell ross how you feel.
2,1,rachel:, come on. how can i just tell him? what about julie?
2,1,joey:, what about her? they've only been going out for two weeks. ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
2,1,rachel:," i don't know, i don't know."
2,1,joey:," look, rach, rach! i've been with my share of women. in fact, i've been with like a lot of people's share of women. the point is, i've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you."
2,1,chandler:," yo, paisan! can i talk to you for a sec? your tailor is a very bad man!"
2,1,joey:, frankie? what're you talking about?
2,1,ross:," hey, what's goin' on? "
2,1,chandler:, joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
2,1,ross:, what?
2,1,joey:, no way. i've been going to the guy for 12 years.
2,1,chandler:," oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
2,1,ross:, what?
2,1,chandler:, cupping.
2,1,joey:," that's how they do pants! first they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. what? ross, ross, would you tell him? isn't that how they measure pants?"
2,1,ross:," yes, yes it is. in prison! whatsa matter with you?"
2,1,joey:, what? that's not? oh my god. 
2,1,monica:, even mary tyler moore would've been better.
2,1,ross:," i like it. i do, i think it's a ten. "
2,1,monica:, thank you. my hair is very amused.
2,1,chandler:," come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and new york city. i know it's crazy, but it's true."
2,1,phoebe:, thank you.
2,1,ross:," well, i gotta go. bye. bye, rach."
2,1,rachel:," wait, are you leaving?"
2,1,ross:," yeah, that's kinda what i meant by ""bye!"""
2,1,rachel:," well, can i talk to you for a sec? "
2,1,ross:, okay. 
2,1,joey:," hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
2,1,chandler:, that's ok. 
2,1,ross:, what's goin' on?
2,1,rachel:," well, first of all, paulo and i are not back together. it was just a stupid thing i did, and if i could go back in time and do it again, well, i wouldn't. um, second of all , what?"
2,1,ross:," ok. well, before i say anything, i just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then i tell you what i think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and i look like a complete idiot?"
2,1,rachel:, no. no no no no.
2,1,ross:," well, then, i think, i think the guy is scum. i hate him. i mean i actuallyi i physically hate him. i always have. you are way too good to be with a guy like that. "
2,1,rachel:, really?
2,1,ross:," you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""oh my god, i'm with rachel"". you know, someone who makes you feel good, the way i am with julie. was there a second of all?"
2,1,rachel:," no, i think that was the whole all."
2,1,ross:, okay.  okay. okay. 
2,1,joey:," i swear to god, dad. that's not how they measure pants. closing credits "

2,2,ross:, carol?
2,2,chandler:, carol? i was just wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast feeding?
2,2,carol:, sure.
2,2,joey:," uh, does it hurt?"
2,2,carol:," it did at first, but not anymore."
2,2,joey:, chandler?
2,2,chandler:," so, uh, how often can you do it?"
2,2,carol:, as much as he needs.

2,2,ross:," so, uh, jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?"

2,2,phoebe:," duh, i think i know how to heat breast milk. ok. "
2,2,chandler:, what did you just do?
2,2,phoebe:," i licked my arm, what?"
2,2,ross:, it's breast milk.
2,2,phoebe:, so?
2,2,rachel:," phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
2,2,joey:, what is the big deal? 
2,2,chandler:, what did you just do?
2,2,ross:," ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
2,2,phoebe:, you won't even taste it?
2,2,ross:, no!
2,2,phoebe:, not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
2,2,ross:, not even if carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. 
2,2,monica:," hey, where is everybody?"
2,2,rachel:, they took ben to the park. where've you been?
2,2,monica:," just out. had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. thanks for your jacket."
2,2,rachel:," oh, no problem. you can borrow it, by the way. here are your keys, hon. "
2,2,monica:, okay.
2,2,rachel:," mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?"
2,2,monica:, you know what probably happened? someone musta stolen my credit card.
2,2,rachel:, and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
2,2,monica:, that is an excellent excellent question. that is excellent.
2,2,rachel:," monica, what is with you? who'd you have lunch with?"
2,2,monica:, judy.
2,2,rachel:, who?
2,2,monica:, julie.
2,2,rachel:, what?!

2,2,monica:," look, when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. and then, one thing led to another and, before i knew it, we were...shopping."
2,2,rachel:, oh. oh my god. 
2,2,monica:," honey, wait. we only did it once. it didn't mean anything to me."
2,2,rachel:," yeah, right.  sure!"
2,2,monica:," really, rachel, i was thinking of you the whole time. look, i'm sorry, all right. i never meant for you to find out!"
2,2,rachel:," oh, please, you wanted to get caught. "
2,2,monica:, that is not true!
2,2,rachel:," oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
2,2,monica:, did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid?
2,2,rachel:," ok, monica. i just have to know one thing. did you go with her to bloomingdale's? oh! ok, ok, ok, i just really, uh, i just really need to not be with you right now. commercial break "
2,2,monica:, hey! 
2,2,carol:, how did we do?
2,2,phoebe:," oh, i tasted ben's milk, and ross freaked out."
2,2,ross:, i did not freak out. 
2,2,carol:, why'd you freak out?
2,2,ross:, because it's breast milk. it's gross.
2,2,carol:, my breast milk is gross?
2,2,susan:, this should be fun.
2,2,ross:," no, no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it. i just, i just don't think breast milk is for adults."
2,2,chandler:, of course the packaging does appeal to grown ups and kids alike.
2,2,carol:," ross, you're being silly. i've tried it, it's no big deal. just taste it. "
2,2,ross:, that would be no.
2,2,phoebe:, come on. it doesn't taste bad.
2,2,joey:," yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
2,2,susan:, cantaloupe juice.
2,2,joey:, exactly.
2,2,ross:, you've tasted it? you've tasted it.
2,2,susan:, uh huh.
2,2,ross:," oh, you've tasted it."
2,2,susan:," you can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
2,2,ross:, gimme the bottle. gimme the towel. 
2,2,chandler:, howdy.
2,2,joey:," gimme a box a juice. well, they switched me over to hombre."
2,2,chandler:," well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
2,2,joey:," or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. you should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
2,2,chandler:, what do you care? you're an actor. this is your day job. this isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
2,2,joey:," i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best. i don't know. maybe i should just get outta the game. they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
2,2,chandler:," all right, say you do that. you know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where're you gonna run?"
2,2,joey:, yeah i guess you're right.
2,2,chandler:, you're damn right i'm right. i say you show this guy what you're made of. i say you stand your ground. i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
2,2,joey:, i'm gonna do it. 
2,2,chandler:, all right. now go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. 
2,2,monica:, i don't know what else to say.
2,2,rachel:," well that works out good, because i'm not listening."
2,2,monica:," i feel terrible, i really do."
2,2,rachel:," oh, i'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
2,2,monica:," rachel, say that i'm friends with her, we spend some time together. is that so terrible?"
2,2,rachel:, yes.
2,2,monica:, it's that terrible?
2,2,rachel:," yes. monica, you don't get it. it's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you."
2,2,monica:," me? what are you talking about? nobody could steal me from you. i mean, just because i'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. i mean, you're my...we're, we're...oh, i love you."
2,2,rachel:, i love you too. 
2,2,phoebe:," you guys, um i know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um i love you guys too. oh, i really needed that. "
2,2,monica:," look, i know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. i mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. i really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. would you just give that a chance, for me?"
2,2,rachel:," i'd do anything for you, you know that."
2,2,monica:, i'd do anything for you. 
2,2,phoebe:," wait, wait, wait, wait! "
2,2,joey:, ready.
2,2,joey:," yeah, i'm ready. "
2,2,customer:," i'm sorry. i am such a doofus. i'm so sorry, i'm so sorry."
2,2,annabelle:," my god, what happened?"
2,2,joey:," these new kids, they never last. sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now?"
2,2,annabelle:, sure. 
2,2,julie:, so.
2,2,rachel:," so. i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. i mean, you know, we've never really talked. i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
2,2,julie:," i know, i probably shouldn't even tell you this, but i'm pretty much totally intimidated by you."
2,2,rachel:, really? me?
2,2,julie:," yes. oh my god, are you kidding? ross is so crazy about you, and i really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't."
2,2,rachel:," well, you're not totally paranoid."
2,2,julie:, oy.
2,2,rachel:," um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which i'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, i just, i see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, monica's always saying how nice you are, and god i hate it when she's right."
2,2,julie:," thanks. hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?"
2,2,rachel:," yeah, that'd be great. i'd love it."
2,2,julie:," i'd love it too. shoot, i gotta go. so, i'll talk to you later."
2,2,rachel:," all right, julie."
2,2,julie:, bye. 
2,2,rachel:, bye. what a manipulative bitch. closing credits 
2,2,ross:, that's not bad. 
2,3,chandler:, hey.
2,3,monica:, so how was joan?
2,3,chandler:, i broke up with her. 
2,3,chandler:," they were huge. when she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
2,3,rachel:," come on, they were not that huge."
2,3,chandler:," i'm tellin' you, she leaned back, i could see her brain."
2,3,monica:, how many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
2,3,joey:," hold it hold it. i gotta side with chandler on this one. when i first moved to the city, i went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest adam's apple. it made me nuts."
2,3,chandler:, you or me?
2,3,ross:," i got it. uh, joey, women don't have adam's apples."
2,3,joey:," you guys are messin' with me, right?"
2,3,all:, yeah.
2,3,joey:," that was a good one. for a second there, i was like, ""whoa."""
2,3,phoebe:, you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
2,3,chandler:, maureen rosilla.
2,3,ross:, not hating yanni is not a real reason. 
2,3,monica:, you're doing it again.
2,3,monica:, you're stomping. it's disturbing my birds.
2,3,rachel:, i could have birds.
2,3,monica:, thank you. i'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
2,3,rachel:," all right, bye bye."
2,3,chandler:," ok, janice. janice. you gotta give me janice. that wasn't about being picky."
2,3,ross:, we'll give you janice.
2,3,phoebe:," i miss janice though. ""hello, chandler bing."""
2,3,rachel:," ""oh, my, god."""
2,3,joey:," ""oh, chandler, now, now, that's it. there, faster!"""
2,3,monica:," stop with the broom, we're not making noise."
2,3,rachel:, we won. we won!
2,3,monica:, mr. heckles.
2,3,rachel:, he musta been sweepin'. they found a broom in his hand.
2,3,monica:, you never know.
2,3,phoebe:," ok, it's very faint, but i can still sense him in the building. go into the light, mr. heckles!"
2,3,chandler:," ok, phoebe."
2,3,phoebe:," i'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. that's fine. go ahead and scoff. you know, there're a lot of things that i don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true."
2,3,joey:, such as?
2,3,phoebe:," like crop circles, or the bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
2,3,ross:," whoa, whoa, whoa. what, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"
2,3,phoebe:, nah. not really.
2,3,ross:, you don't believe in evolution?
2,3,phoebe:," i don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, i just think it's a little too easy."
2,3,ross:," too easy? too...the process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single celled organisms, too easy?"
2,3,phoebe:," yeah, i just don't buy it."
2,3,ross:," uh, excuse me. evolution is not for you to buy, phoebe. evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity."
2,3,phoebe:," ok, don't get me started on gravity."
2,3,ross:," you uh, you don't believe in gravity?"
2,3,phoebe:," well, it's not so much that you know, like i don't believe in it, you know, it's just...i don't know, lately i get the feeling that i'm not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed. "
2,3,chandler:," there she is. and over there, that's the other one. this is mr. buddy boyle, mr. heckles' attorney. he'd like to talk to you."
2,3,monica:," all right, kids. here's the deal. according to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ""the noisy girls in the apartment above mine""."
2,3,monica:, he didn't have any.
2,3,rachel:," all right, there was none. let's talk signing. you be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two."
2,3,monica:," i can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. i mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...would you look at this dump? he hated us. this is his final revenge!"
2,3,rachel:, have you ever seen so much crap?
2,3,chandler:," actually, i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
2,3,joey:, check this out. can i have this?
2,3,ross:, how can you not believe in evolution?
2,3,phoebe:, just don't. look at this funky shirt!
2,3,ross:," pheebs, i have studied evolution my entire adult life. ok, i can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? you can literally see them evolving through time."
2,3,phoebe:, really? you can actually see it?
2,3,ross:," you bet. in the u.s., china, africa, all over."
2,3,phoebe:," see, i didn't know that."
2,3,ross:," well, there you go."
2,3,phoebe:," huh. so now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?"
2,3,chandler:," hey, look at this. ""my big book of grievances."""
2,3,joey:," hey, there's me! april 17th. excessive noise. italian guy comes homes with a date. hey chandler, look, you're in here too."
2,3,chandler:," april 18th, excessive noise. italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry cleaning. well that's excellent."
2,3,rachel:," monica, monica, look at this lamp. is this tacky or what? we have to have this."
2,3,monica:," rache, i think we have enough regular lamps."
2,3,rachel:," what? come on, it's not like i'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, i also think is very cool."
2,3,monica:, it doesn't go with any of my stuff.
2,3,rachel:," well, what about my stuff?"
2,3,monica:, you don't have any stuff.
2,3,rachel:," you still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
2,3,monica:, no.
2,3,rachel:," yes you do. you think of it as your apartment, and i'm just somebody who rents a room."
2,3,monica:, mmmmm.
2,3,rachel:," ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, i'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp."
2,3,ross:," ok, pheebs. see how i'm making these little toys move? opposable thumbs. without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?"
2,3,phoebe:, maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
2,3,ross:, please tell me you're joking.
2,3,phoebe:," look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and i don't."
2,3,ross:," no, no, pheebs, we can't, ok, because "
2,3,phoebe:," what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? no, what's that all about? i think, i think maybe it's time you put ross under the microscope."
2,3,ross:, is there blood coming out of my ears?
2,3,joey:," check it out, check it out. heckles' high school yearbook."
2,3,chandler:," wow, he looks so normal."
2,3,phoebe:, he's even kind of cute.
2,3,joey:," ""heckles, you crack me up in science class. you're the funniest kid in school."
2,3,chandler:, funniest? heckles? 
2,3,joey:, that's what it says.
2,3,chandler:," wow, heckles was voted class clown, and so was i. he was right. would you listen to that?"
2,3,phoebe:, i'd call that excessive.
2,3,chandler:, whoa! 
2,3,joey:, what?
2,3,chandler:," heckles played clarinet in band, and i played clarinet. and he was in the scale modeler's club, and i was, well, there was no club, but i sure thought they were cool."
2,3,joey:," so, you were both dorks. big deal."
2,3,chandler:," i just think it's weird, you know? heckles and me, heckles, and me, me and heckles...would you knock it off?"
2,3,joey:, have you been here all night?
2,3,chandler:," look at this. pictures of all the women that heckles went out with. look what he wrote on them. vivian, too tall. madge, big gums. too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. this is, this is me. this is what i do. i'm gonna end up alone, just like he did."
2,3,joey:," chandler, heckles was a nut case."
2,3,chandler:," our trains are on the same track, ok? yeah, sure, i'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. bitter town. aloneville. hermit junction."
2,3,joey:," all right, you know what we gotta do? we gotta get you outta here. come on, i'll buy you breakfast, let's go."
2,3,chandler:," what if i never find someone? or worse, what if i've found her, but i dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?"
2,3,joey:," chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."
2,3,chandler:, how do you know that? how?
2,3,joey:," i don't know, i'm just tryin' to help you out."
2,3,chandler:," you'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and i'm gonna end up alone. will you promise me something? when you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?"
2,3,joey:," well, i don't know. i don't know what we're gonna be doin'. i mean, what if we're at her folks' place?"
2,3,chandler:," yeah, i understand."
2,3,joey:," you can come over and watch the super bowl. every year, all right?"
2,3,chandler:, you know what? i'm not gonna end up like this. i'll see you man.
2,3,joey:, supposably. supposably. did they go to the zoo? supposably.
2,3,chandler:," hi, it's me."
2,3,janice:," oh, my, god."
2,3,phoebe:, janice? you called janice?
2,3,chandler:," yes, janice. why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?"
2,3,ross:," you remember janice, right?"
2,3,chandler:," yes. she was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. janice is my last chance to have somebody."
2,3,janice:, helloo!!
2,3,chandler:," oh, my, god!"
2,3,joey:," geez, look how fat she got."
2,3,janice:," hey, it's everybody."
2,3,chandler:," janice, you're "
2,3,janice:," yes, i am."
2,3,chandler:, is it ?
2,3,janice:," is it yours? ha! you wish, chandler bing. you are looking at a married lady now."
2,3,chandler:, congratulations.
2,3,janice:," oh, sweetie, i'm sorry."
2,3,chandler:, you couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
2,3,janice:, and what? missed the expression on your face? janice likes to have her fun.
2,3,monica:," hey, rache. you know what we haven't played in a while?"
2,3,rachel:, what?
2,3,monica:, hide the lamp.
2,3,rachel:," monica, let it go."
2,3,monica:, did you know i was allergic to shellfish?
2,3,rachel:," well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps."
2,3,phoebe:, uh oh. it's scary scientist man.
2,3,ross:," ok, phoebe, this is it. in this briefcase i carry actual scientific facts. a briefcase of facts, if you will. some of these fossils are over 200 million years old."
2,3,phoebe:," ok, look, before you even start, i'm not denying evolution, ok, i'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities."
2,3,ross:," it's the only possibility, phoebe."
2,3,phoebe:," ok, ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? and, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?"
2,3,ross:," there might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility."
2,3,phoebe:, i can't believe you caved.
2,3,ross:, what?
2,3,phoebe:," you just abandoned your whole belief system. i mean, before, i didn't agree with you, but at least i respected you. how, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? how, how are you going to face the other science guys? how, how are you going to face yourself? oh! that was fun. so who's hungry?"
2,3,rachel:, i am. let me just get my coat.
2,3,monica:," ok, all right. it was an accident, i swear, all right. i was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke."
2,3,rachel:," oh, please, monica. you've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?"
2,3,monica:," phoebe, tell her!"
2,3,phoebe:," ok, i didn't see it, because i was putting on my jacket, but i uh want to believe you."
2,3,rachel:, hey chandler. monica just broke my seashell lamp.
2,3,chandler:, neat. i'm gonna die alone.
2,3,rachel:," ok, you win."
2,3,monica:," chandler, you're not gonna die alone."
2,3,chandler:," janice was my safety net, ok? and now i have to get a snake."
2,3,phoebe:, uh huh. why is that?
2,3,chandler:," if i'm gonna be an old, lonely man, i'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. so i figure i'll be crazy man with a snake, y=know. crazy snake man. and i'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""run away from crazy snake man,"" they'll shout!"
2,3,monica:, you have got to get over this. you're not gonna end up alone.
2,3,chandler:," of course i am. i reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then i bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there."
2,3,rachel:," chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with."
2,3,monica:, you are not a freak. you're a guy.
2,3,rachel:, she's right. she's right. you are no different than the rest of them.
2,3,monica:," wait a minute, wait a minute. yes he is. you are totally different."
2,3,chandler:, in a bad way?
2,3,monica:," no, honey, in a wonderful way. you know what you want now. most guys don't even have a clue. you are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone."
2,3,rachel:, yeah. you're not gonna end up alone.
2,3,phoebe:," chandler, you called janice! that's how much you wanted to be with someone!"
2,3,monica:, you made it!
2,3,phoebe:, you're there!
2,3,rachel:, you are ready to make a commitment!
2,3,chandler:, whoa! don't know about that.
2,3,rachel:, what you got there? something else that's not yours that you can break?
2,3,monica:," no. um, i know you like this, and i want you to have it. i think it'll look good in our apartment."
2,3,rachel:, thank you.
2,3,monica:, that's fine.
2,3,chandler:," hey. well, you will all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night. this woman, alison, from work. she's great. she's pretty, she's smart. and uh, i've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. but, i'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. look at me. i'm growing."
2,3,joey:," hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?"
2,3,chandler:, i'll take that.
2,3,joey:, you want his yearbook?
2,3,chandler:," yeah, yeah. some people said some nice things about him. i think somebody should have it."
2,3,monica:," oh, gosh, this is so weird. i mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. you know, i think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for mr. heckles. i mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. you're all going to hell."
2,3,rachel:, it's really not that big!
2,3,chandler:," takin' that with you, huh?"
2,3,joey:," oh, yeah."
2,3,ross:, you comin'?
2,3,chandler:," yeah, jus' second. good bye mr. heckles. we'll try to keep it down."
2,3,alison:," oh, my major was totally useless. i mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see ""philosopher wanted""?"
2,3,chandler:, sure. 
2,4,rachel:," mom, would you relax. that was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, i would never do that. mom, c'mon, stop worrying. this is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing "
2,4,stranger:, hi.
2,4,rachel:," hi, hi can i help you?"
2,4,stranger:," yeah, i'm looking for phoebe, does she still live here?"
2,4,rachel:," uh, no she doesn't but i can, i can get a message to her."
2,4,stranger:," great. uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. "
2,4,rachel:, what? 
2,4,stranger:," hey, how, how did you do that? opening titles "
2,4,joey:," this is unbelievable phoebs, how can you be married?"
2,4,phoebe:," well, i mean, i'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from canada and he just needed a green card."
2,4,monica:," i can't believe you married duncan. i mean how could you not tell me? we lived together, we told each other everything."
2,4,phoebe:," i'm sorry monica but i knew if i told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve."
2,4,monica:," of course i wouldn't approve, i mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. i mean, what the hell were you thinking?"
2,4,ross:," you see, and you thought she'd be judgemental."
2,4,phoebe:," ok, i wasn't in love with him and i was just helping out a friend."
2,4,monica:," please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and i saw you eat a cheeseburger."
2,4,all:, huuh.
2,4,monica:," well, didn't you?"
2,4,phoebe:, i might have.
2,4,monica:, i can't believe you didn't tell me.
2,4,phoebe:," oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything."
2,4,monica:, what have i not told you?
2,4,phoebe:," oh, i don't know. umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with fun bobby out on the terrace."
2,4,rachel:, what!
2,4,monica:," wait a minute, who told you? you are dead meat."
2,4,chandler:, i didn't know it was a big secret.
2,4,monica:," oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh i don't know, having a third nipple."
2,4,phoebe:, you have a third nipple?
2,4,chandler:, you bitch.
2,4,ross:," whip it out, whip it out."
2,4,chandler:," c'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless."
2,4,rachel:," oh as, as opposed to your other multi functional nipples?"
2,4,joey:, i can't believe you. you told me it was a nubbin.
2,4,ross:," joey, what did you think a nubbin was?"
2,4,joey:," i don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, i thought that's what it was. let me see it again."
2,4,all:," yeah, show it. show it. the nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin."
2,4,chandler:, joey was in a porno movie.
2,4,all:, huuh.
2,4,chandler:," if i'm goin' down, i'm takin' everybody with me."
2,4,ross:, you were in a porno?
2,4,joey:," ahh, alright, alright, alright, i was young and i just wanted a job, ok. but at the last minute i couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it."
2,4,monica:, that is wild.
2,4,ross:, so what's it shaped like?
2,4,phoebe:," yeah, is there a hair on it?"
2,4,joey:, what happens if you flick it? 
2,4,ross:," so, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
2,4,chandler:," why yes ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of narnia."
2,4,julie:," you know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. you get the best huts and women dance naked around you."
2,4,chandler:," huh? are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri state area?"
2,4,ross:," you know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
2,4,rachel:," ooh, julie's so smart, julie's so special."
2,4,monica:," look honey, i wanted you to hook up with ross as much as you did. but he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it."
2,4,rachel:," ohh, i'm gonna have to get over it. god, see i didn't know that's i had to do, i just have to get over it. "
2,4,all:, woah.
2,4,joey:, foxy lady.
2,4,julie:, where you goin'?
2,4,phoebe:," um, i'm gonna go meet duncan, he's skating tonight at the garden, he's in the capades."
2,4,joey:, the ice capades?
2,4,chandler:," no, no the gravel capades. yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when snoopy falls. . . funny."
2,4,monica:," i can't believe you're dressing up for him. i mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again."
2,4,phoebe:," ok, no. for your information i'm going to see him so i can put all those feeling behind me. ok, and the reason i'm dressed like this is because i think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband."
2,4,ross:," hey chandler, would you fill me up here?"
2,4,chandler:," oh i see, i see, because of the third nipple thing. ha ha ha ha. . . "
2,4,ross:," ok sweetie, i'll see you later."

2,4,ross:," technically, huh, no."
2,4,rachel:," wow. is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?"
2,4,ross:," no, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. i mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . ."
2,4,rachel:," no, no no no, don't need to know the details."
2,4,ross:," it's just, it's, it's me. you, you know i've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. so now i've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and i. . . well, you just must think i'm weird."
2,4,rachel:," no, no, no, no i don't think it's weird, i think, i think umm, in fact, in fact you know what i think?"
2,4,ross:, what?
2,4,rachel:, i think it's sexy.

2,4,rachel:, oh yeah. in fact you know what i'd do?
2,4,ross:, what?

2,4,rachel:," oh yeah, i don't care how much she tells you she wants it, i don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. that just means it's working."
2,4,ross:, women really want this?

2,4,phoebe:, sure.
2,4,duncan:," but now i know i don't have a choice about this, i was born this way."
2,4,phoebe:," i, i don't know what to say. i mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'oh, i'm not gay.'"
2,4,duncan:," i'm, i'm still me."
2,4,phoebe:, why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?

2,4,ross:, really?
2,4,rachel:," yeah, i mean, you know it, i mean, if it were me i, i, you know, i'd want you to, i don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen."
2,4,ross:, uh huh.
2,4,rachel:," and then, i don't know, i mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that i'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. and, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening."
2,4,ross:," ohh. . . thanks rach, goodnight. "

2,5,rachel:," do you guys ever get the feeling that um, chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?"
2,5,joey:," yes! yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go there"". like we can afford to go here and there."
2,5,phoebe:," yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? god, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for ross."

2,5,jade:, it was just so awkward and bumpy.
2,5,ross:, bumpy?
2,5,chandler:," well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. and uh maybe you have to get used to it."
2,5,jade:," well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what i mean? "
2,5,monica:, you know what? i'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

2,7,joey:," so, so how did it happen?"
2,7,phoe:," well, i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on."
2,7,joey:, and what did he say?
2,7,phoe:," he said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah la la la la. so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious."
2,7,joey:, wow.
2,7,phoe:," yeah, so i said, ""ok, relax please,"" y'know, i mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. so after a looooot of talking. . . i convinced him."
2,7,joey:," let me get this straight. he got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea."
2,7,phoe:, um hum.
2,7,joey:, this man is my god. 
2,7,rach:, hi.
2,7,ross:, i didn't get a cat.
2,7,rach:," oh, that's um, interesting."
2,7,ross:," no, no it's not interesting. ok, it's very, very not interesting. in fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting."
2,7,rach:," alright, i got it ross."
2,7,ross:, you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
2,7,rach:, what?
2,7,ross:, i was doing great with julie before i found out about you.
2,7,rach:," hey, i was doin' great before i found out about you. you think it's easy for me to see you with julie?"
2,7,ross:, then you should have said something before i met her.
2,7,rach:, i didn't know then. and how come you never said anything to me.
2,7,ross:, there was never a good time.
2,7,rach:," right, you, you only had a year. we only hung out every night."
2,7,ross:," not, not, not every night. you know, and... and it's not like i didn't try, rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? like, like italian guys or ex fiances or, or, or italian guys."
2,7,rach:," hey, there was one italian guy, ok, and do you even have a point?"
2,7,ross:," the point is i... i don't need this right now, ok. it, it's too late, i'm with somebody else, i'm happy. this ship has sailed."
2,7,rach:," yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?"
2,7,ross:," hey, i've been doin' it since the ninth grade, i've gotten pretty damn good at it."
2,7,rach:," alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright ross."
2,7,ross:, fine.

2,8,phoe:," ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? or was it like a, you know, a ""i gotta have you now"" kind of thing?"
2,8,rach:," well, at first it was really intense, you know. and then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it."
2,8,phoe:," ok, so, ok, was he holding you? or was his hand like on your back?"
2,8,rach:, ohhhh.

2,8,joey:, you got all that from saline solution?

2,8,rtst:, mockolate.
2,8,mnca:, i'm sorry?
2,8,rtst:, mockolate. it's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
2,8,mnca:, ohh. 
2,8,rtst:," go ahead. try a piece. yeah, we think that mockolate is even better than chocolate."
2,8,mnca:, all right. mmm mmm. 
2,8,rtst:, yeah?
2,8,mnca:," i love how it crumbles. now see, your chocolate doesn't do that."
2,8,rtst:," easter, christmas, what have you."
2,8,mnca:, mmm mmm.
2,8,rtst:," but, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make thanksgiving the mockolate holiday."
2,8,mnca:, wow.
2,8,rtst:, aren't you going to swallow that?
2,8,mnca:, just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
2,8,rtst:," yeah, isn't that great?"
2,8,mnca:, mmm.
2,8,rtst:," well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some thanksgiving themed recipes. you think you might be interested?"

2,8,rtst:, really?
2,8,mnca:," especially the after taste, you know, i'll tell ya, that'll last ya till christmas. "
2,8,mnca:, how about mockolate mousse?
2,8,phoe:," it's not, it's not very thanksgiving y."
2,8,mnca:," ok, how about pilgrim mockolate mousse?"
2,8,phoe:, what makes it pilgrim?

2,8,mnca:," no, i'm sorry."
2,8,rach:," why didn't he call? he's gonna stay with julie, isn't he? he's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""hi, i'm julie, ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."""
2,8,phoe:," no offense, but that sounds nothing like her. "
2,8,ross:," i don't know what to do. what am i gonna do? i mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare."
2,8,chan:," oh, i know. this must be so hard. oh, no. two women love me. they're both gorgeous and sexy. my wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight."
2,8,joey:," hey, here's a thought, ross. "
2,8,chan:, don't touch the computer. don't ever touch the computer.
2,8,joey:," ross, listen. i got two words for you. threesome. "
2,8,chan:," ok, all right, look. let's get logical about this, ok? we'll make a list. rachel and julie, pros and cons. oh. we'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and i can use different colors for each column."
2,8,ross:, can't we just use a pen?
2,8,chan:," no, amish boy."
2,8,joey:," ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. all right, rachel first."
2,8,ross:," i don't know. i mean, all right, i guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes."
2,8,joey:, you could say that.
2,8,ross:," and i guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. and i've seen her be a little too into her looks. oh, and julie and i, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but rachel's just a waitress."
2,8,chan:, waitress. got it. you guys wanna play doom? or we could keep doing this. what else?
2,8,ross:, i don't know.
2,8,joey:," oh, her ankles are a little chubby."
2,8,chan:," ok, let's do julie. what's wrong with her?"
2,8,ross:, 
2,8,mnca:," ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. this is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. just like the indians served. "
2,8,rach:, oh my god.
2,8,mnca:, oh my god good?
2,8,rach:," oh my god, i can't believe you let me put this in my mouth. "
2,8,phoe:," oh, oh sweet lord! this is what evil must taste like! "
2,8,chan:," i'm telling you this thing won't print. yes, i pressed that button like 100 times. you know, for a hot line you are not so hot. what? what is that in the background? are you watching star trek? "
2,8,joey:," hey, so how'd it go with julie? did you, did you break her heart?"
2,8,ross:," yes, it was horrible. she cried. i cried. she threw things, they hit me. anyway, i did the right thing."
2,8,chan:, 
2,8,rach:," hey, do you guys have... ...hi."
2,8,ross:, hi.
2,8,rach:, where you goin'?
2,8,ross:," i uh, i just got back from uh, from julie's."
2,8,rach:, oh.
2,8,ross:," no, no, uh, it's not what you think. it's um the other thing."
2,8,rach:," well, what's the other thing, what do i think? "
2,8,ross:," well, uh."
2,8,joey:," he broke up with julie. well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
2,8,rach:, really?
2,8,ross:," really. it's always been you, rach. "
2,8,rach:, ohhh.
2,8,rach:," oh, oh, this is good, this is really good."
2,8,ross:," i know, i know, it's, it's almost... what do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?"
2,8,rach:, let me get my coat.
2,8,ross:," ok. no, hey, whoa, whoa, i'll get your coat. "
2,8,rach:," ok, he's goin' to get my coat. he's goin' to get my coat. oh my god, you guys. i can't believe this. this is unbelievable. what's that?"
2,8,chan:, 
2,8,rach:, what's that? what? i saw my name. what is it?
2,8,chan:," no, no, see? see? "
2,8,rach:, well what is it? let me see. 
2,8,ross:," hey, someone order a coat?"
2,8,rach:," ross, chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see."
2,8,ross:," he won't? he won't! because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?"
2,8,chan:," yes, yes it is, short story, that i was writing."
2,8,rach:, no!
2,8,rach:, come on.
2,8,joey:," hey, uh, why don't you read it to her? "
2,8,chan:," ""it was summer, and it was hot. rachel was there. a lonely gray couch. 'oh, look,' cried ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. the end."""
2,8,ross:, that's it? that's all you wrote? you're the worst writer in the whole world.
2,8,rach:," all right, you know what? this isn't funny anymore. there's something about me on that piece of paper and i want to see it."
2,8,ross:," no, you don't."
2,8,rach:," all right, you know what, that's fine. if you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. i do not need to see it. "
2,8,rach:," what is this? ross, what is this?"
2,8,chan:, good luck. 
2,8,ross:," ok, just, just remember how crazy i am about you, ok?"
2,8,rach:, kind of ditzy? too into her looks? spoiled?
2,8,ross:," now that's a little spoiled. he was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot."
2,8,rach:, just a waitress?
2,8,ross:," no, that, that was, i mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. is this over yet rach?"
2,8,rach:, oh! i do not have chubby ankles! 
2,8,ross:," no, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. look at julie's column."
2,8,rach:, she is not rachem. what the hell's a rachem? is that some stupid paleontology word that i wouldn't know because i'm just a waitress. 
2,8,ross:," no, rach, come on. rach! rach, no, no! she's not rachel, she is, she is not, ra rachel? "
2,8,chan:," my diary! my diary, that's brilliant. i should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary."
2,8,mnca:," you know, that's true. you'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency."
2,8,phoe:, i... i cannot believe ross even made this list. what a dinkus.
2,8,joey:," hey, cut him some slack. it was chandler's idea."
2,8,phoe:, what?
2,8,mnca:, what?
2,8,chan:," oh good, i was hoping that would come up."
2,8,mnca:, this was your idea?
2,8,phoe:, what were you thinking?
2,8,chan:," all right, let's get some perspective here, ok? these things, they happen for a reason."
2,8,mnca:, yeah. you!
2,8,chan:," all right, pheebs, back me up here, ok? you believe in that karma crap, don't you?"
2,8,phoe:," yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle. "
2,8,ross:," rach! whoops! rach, hey, open up, please!"
2,8,rach:," when somebody does not buzz you in, ross, that means go away. that doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape."
2,8,ross:, i just wanna read something. it's your pro list.
2,8,rach:, not interested. 
2,8,ross:, 
2,8,ross:, the way you smell.
2,8,joey:," hey, ross! what are you doin'?"
2,8,ross:," hey, joey. you wanna open the window?"
2,8,joey:," oh, yeah, i do. "
2,8,chan:, what are you doing out there?
2,8,ross:," i am, uh, i am..."
2,8,mnca:," oh, you must be freezing. you know what you need? how about a nice steaming cup of hot mockolate? "
2,8,ross:," rach, come on, open up. rach, come on, come on, rach. you got to give me another chance. "
2,8,rach:, no.
2,8,ross:, no?
2,8,rach:, that's what i said.
2,8,chan:," look, maybe we should go?"
2,8,rach:," no, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking."
2,8,ross:," rach, come on, look, i know how you must feel."
2,8,rach:," no, you don't, ross. imagine the worst things you think about yourself. now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you."
2,8,ross:," no, but, but i wanna be with you in spite of all those things."
2,8,rach:," oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, ross. i said don't go!"
2,8,ross:," you know what? you know what? if, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you."
2,8,rach:," well, then, i guess that's the difference between us. see, i'd never make a list. "
2,8,joey:, 
2,8,mnca:," now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. i've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate."
2,8,rtst:, doesn't matter.
2,8,mnca:, what?
2,8,rtst:, our fda approval didn't come through. something about laboratory rats.
2,8,mnca:," oh, gosh, i'm sorry."

2,9,grandmother:," alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame."
2,9,phoebe:, oh god.
2,9,grandmother:," it was your mother's idea. ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, i didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. not impossible, but harder."
2,9,phoebe:," alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? and then, i guess, ok, he doesn't live in a hut in burma where there's no phones?"
2,9,grandmother:," last i heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate."
2,9,phoebe:," ok, that makes no sense. why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?"
2,9,grandmother:, honey.
2,9,phoebe:, oh.
2,9,grandmother:," anyway, that's all i know. that, and this. this is the real him."
2,9,phoebe:, oh. 
2,9,chandler:," ya know i remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. he didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up."

2,10,joey:," monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?"
2,10,mnca:," well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. i mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? or... or to a club, or to the... zoo. "
2,10,mnca:," rach, does this have nonfat milk?"

2,10,fbob:," well, i would make them belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask."
2,10,mnca:, bobby.
2,10,fbob:," yeah, ok."
2,10,mnca:," look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, i don't know... but, uh, i'm kind of worried about you."
2,10,fbob:," ok, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, i don't know... i always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'i'm just a social drinker,' or, 'c'mon, it's flag day.'"
2,10,mnca:," so, what are you saying now?"
2,10,fbob:," i guess i'm saying, i'll try and quit. i kinda like that you worry about me. "
2,10,phoe:," sooo, what's goin' on, huh?"

2,10,mnca:, not that bad? did you hear the hammer story?
2,10,phoe:," ok, ok, don't get all squinky."
2,10,rach:, maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
2,10,mnca:," but i'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. i mean, i can't break up with him. i'm the one who made him quit drinking. he's dull because of me."

2,10,ross:, ....................yeah. 
2,10,chan:, hey.
2,10,joey:, hey.
2,10,chan:," whoa, whoa, so i'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, italy called and said it was hungry."
2,10,joey:," well, the part's mine if i want it."
2,10,chan:, oh my god!
2,10,joey:," yeah, if i'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
2,10,chan:, oh my... god?
2,10,joey:," ten years i've been waiting for a break like this chandler, ten years! i mean, days of our lives. that's actually on television."
2,10,chan:," so, what're you gonna do?"
2,10,joey:," well, i guess i could sleep with her... i mean, how could i do that?"
2,10,chan:," well, i... i've got a pop up book that told me everything i need to know."
2,10,joey:, i've never slept with someone for a part.
2,10,chan:, well is she... 
2,10,joey:, sorry.
2,10,chan:, it's alright. is she good looking?
2,10,joey:," yeah, she's totally good looking. i mean, if i met her in a bar, or something, i'd be buying her breakfast. you know, after having slept with her."
2,10,chan:," y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. y'know, i mean, the way that i see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. y'know, i mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got christmas."
2,10,joey:," i just... i just don't think that i want it that way though, y'know? i mean, let's say i do make it, alright? i'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the little general."
2,10,chan:, didn't you used to call it the little major?
2,10,joey:," yeah, but after denise demarco, i had to promote it. "
2,10,waiter:, can i get you something from the bar?
2,10,mnca:," yes, i would like something. no, no thank you."
2,10,fbob:," if... if you want to drink, it's ok with me, i've got to get used to it."
2,10,mnca:," no, no really. i.. i wouldn't feel right about it. just some water."
2,10,fbob:, so the light went out in my refrigerator...
2,10,mnca:, 
2,10,chan:," hey, we're having some fun now, huh, ross? wanna do another one, huh russ? ok... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium."
2,10,russ:, dysprosium.
2,10,ross:, dysprosium? try mendelevium.
2,10,chan:," and weenie number two has it. unless, of course, nine down, knights in white satin was sung by the doody blues. "
2,10,phoe:, you don't see it? you actually don't see it?
2,10,rach:, what?

2,10,phoe:," ok, noone is named sleeve."
2,10,rach:," phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? other than their names being similar, i'm sorry, i do not see what you're seeing. "
2,10,ross:," for your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark."
2,10,russ:, you could not be more wrong. you could try... but you would not be successful.
2,10,chan:," ok, i'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye poking begins."
2,10,russ:, i know what your problem is.
2,10,ross:," oh you do, do you?"
2,10,russ:," um hum, you're jealous."
2,10,ross:, of... of what?
2,10,russ:, you're jealous because i'm a real doctor.
2,10,ross:," hey, you're a doctor of gums. that's the smallest body part you can major in. it's like day one, floss. day two, here's your diploma."
2,10,russ:," hey, you listen."
2,10,ross:," no, no, let me finish."
2,10,russ:," no, let me finish."
2,10,ross:," no, you let me fini... "

2,10,rach:," ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! "

2,10,chan:," no, i don't even think he knew. hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?"
2,10,rach:, i don't know. who would i have to sleep with?
2,10,chan:, me.
2,10,rach:, why would i have to sleep with you?
2,10,chan:, it's my game. you want the job or not? 
2,10,chan:, hey.

2,10,mnca:," bobby and i are going away for the weekend, remember?"
2,10,ross:, ooooohhhh. 
2,10,phoe:, what's with all the bottles of liquor?
2,10,ross:," what's going on, is... uh, bobby drinking again?"
2,10,mnca:," oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. that way he's still sober but i find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing. "
2,10,rach:," oh god, even his knock is boring. "
2,10,mnca:, hi. i'll be ready in just a second.
2,10,fbob:," uh, can i talk to you a minute?"
2,10,mnca:, sure. 
2,10,fbob:, this is really hard for me to say.
2,10,mnca:," oh god, you fell off the wagon."
2,10,fbob:," oh, no, no, it's about you."
2,10,mnca:, what about me?
2,10,fbob:, i think you may have a drinking problem.
2,10,mnca:," what these? oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes."
2,10,fbob:," look, i am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, ok?"
2,10,mnca:, oh... shoot.
2,10,fbob:," well, anyway, i hope we can be friends."
2,10,mnca:, ok. 
2,10,mnca:, take care.
2,10,fbob:, you too. 
2,10,rach:, what happened?
2,10,mnca:, well we... we kinda broke up.
2,10,gang:, awwwwwwww. 
2,10,mnca:, does anybody want these?
2,10,chan:, i'll take one. sometimes i like to hold stuff like this and pretend i'm a giant. 
2,10,joey:, hey.
2,10,gang:, hey!
2,10,ross:, how'd the callback go?
2,10,joey:, it was unbelievable! i walked in there and she was all over me.
2,10,chan:, so what'd you do?
2,10,joey:," well, i couldn't do it. i told her i didn't want to get the part that way."
2,10,ross:, good for you.
2,10,joey:," but wait, wait, wait. then, after i left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part."
2,10,phoe:, so... and?
2,10,joey:," soooooo... you are now looking at dr. drake ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!"
2,10,gang:, allright!
2,10,joey:, alright... i've got to go shower. 
2,10,russ:, hi.
2,10,chan:," oh, hey."
2,10,phoe:, hi.
2,10,russ:," i guess you guys heard, rachel dumped me."
2,10,chan:," yeah, i'm sorry man."
2,10,russ:," oh, all she said was that i remind her too much of somebody. you have any idea who she's talking about? "
2,10,phoe:," oh i do, it's.... it's bob saget. she hates him."
2,10,russ:, oh. 
2,10,julie:, hey.
2,10,chan:, hey!
2,10,phoe:," hey, julie! hey, how are you doing?"
2,10,julie:," um, oh, i don't know. i mean, it's definitely weird not being with ross, but i guess i'm doing ok. actually i've got some of his stuff that he, um.... "
2,11,ross:," ok. here's his diaper bag, and his uh, mr. winky, and uh...oh, him. hi!"
2,11,carol:, so how did everything go?
2,11,ross:," oh, great. great. there was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it."
2,11,carol:," well, we've gotta go."
2,11,ross:, ok.
2,11,susan:, 
2,11,carol:," oh, right. um, i've got some news. it's about us."
2,11,ross:," oh, you and me?"
2,11,carol:," uh, no, susan and me."
2,11,susan:, the other us.
2,11,ross:, ok.
2,11,carol:," we're uh, we're getting married."
2,11,ross:," as in, ""i now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?"
2,11,carol:," anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to."
2,11,ross:, why wouldn't i want to come? i had fun at the first wedding.
2,11,carol:, look i just thought that...
2,11,ross:," no no no, i mean, hey, why shouldn't i be happy for you? what would it say about me if i couldn't revel in your joy? i'm revelling baby, believe me!"
2,11,susan:, is your finger caught in that chair?
2,11,ross:, mmm hmmm.
2,11,carol:, want us to go?
2,11,ross:, uh huh. 
2,11,ross:, this is so cool. you're actually gonna be on television.
2,11,joey:," it really hit me last night. i'm gonna be on days of our lives. and then i started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.."
2,11,monica:, yes!
2,11,monica:," they want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as i've never catered before, and i really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?"
2,11,ross:, would it matter?
2,11,monica:," oh, you are so great! thank you!"
2,11,joey:, are you really not going?
2,11,ross:," i am really not going. i don't get it. they already live together, why do they need to get married?"
2,11,monica:," they love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them."
2,11,ross:, if you wanna call that a reason.
2,11,chandler:," who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? hi, neighbor."
2,11,monica:," ross, i thought you were over this."
2,11,ross:," look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? she's my ex wife. if she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there."
2,11,joey:," hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever."
2,11,rachel:, did i miss it? did i miss it?
2,11,joey:," no, i'm on right after this guy shoots himself."
2,11,chandler:," whoa, she's pretty."
2,11,joey:," yeah, and she's really nice too. she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell the fart acting."
2,11,rachel:," i'm sorry, what?"
2,11,monica:, what?
2,11,joey:," it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. "
2,11,chandler:," oh, ok."
2,11,joey:, is she gonna be all right?
2,11,joey:, i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
2,11,chandler:, nice!
2,11,rachel:, that's great!
2,11,ross:, excellent!
2,11,chandler:, for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin' to smell something. 
2,11,ross:, that is so good! do it again!
2,11,joey:," all right, all right. ""damnit braverman, it's right there on the chart!"""
2,11,chandler:," that's great. all right, i gotta get to work, i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect."
2,11,ross:," no no, that's me."
2,11,chandler:," oh, yeah. "
2,11,ross:," oh, hello."
2,11,phoebe:," oh, thanks. i couldn't uh..."
2,11,ross:, is everything ok?
2,11,phoebe:," um, no, huh uh. one of my clients died on the massage table today."
2,11,ross:, oh my god.
2,11,chandler:, that's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
2,11,phoebe:," yeah, um, she was 82 years old. her name was um, mrs. adelman."
2,11,monica:," oh, honey."
2,11,phoebe:," yeah, it's just so strange. i mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, i'll have some breakfast, and then i'll take a little walk, and then i'll have my massage."" little did she know god was thinking, ""ok, but that's it."" oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, i was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, i don't think it went very far."
2,11,rachel:, what do you mean?
2,11,phoebe:, i think it went into me. 
2,11,monica:," god, this is so hard. i can't decide between lamb or duck."
2,11,chandler:," well, of course, lambs are scarier. otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the ducks."
2,11,rachel:," ok, who ordered what?"
2,11,ross:," oh, i believe i had the half drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim."
2,11,chandler:," yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?"
2,11,rachel:, oh god.
2,11,joey:, i can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
2,11,rachel:," i know, but it's just it's the first time, and i just don't want her to think that because i didn't marry barry, that my life is total crap, you know?"
2,11,phoebe:, talk about crap. try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time.
2,11,joey:," uh, pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?"
2,11,phoebe:," i don't know. i mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. there she is."
2,11,rachel:," sweetie! so this is where you work? oh, it's wonderful! is it a living room? is it a restaurant? who can tell? but i guess that's the fun."
2,11,rachel:," monica! you look gorgeous! last time i saw you, it was eat or be eaten."
2,11,rachel:," oh hello, ross. "
2,11,ross:," so, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?"
2,11,rachel:," if you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink."
2,11,chandler:," this is just so exciting. you know, i never worked. i went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. i am just so proud of you."
2,11,rachel:, yes.
2,11,phoebe:," i know who it is you remind me of. evelyn dermer. 'course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. now she looks like soupy sales."
2,11,joey:," pheebs, who's evelyn dermer?"
2,11,phoebe:," oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello."
2,11,rachel:," you have some life here, sweetie."
2,11,rachel:," i do. you didn't love barry. and i've never seen you this happy. i look at you and i think, oh, this is what i want."
2,11,rachel:," well, not just for you."
2,11,rachel:," i'm uh, considering leaving your father."
2,11,monica:," all right. tell me if this is too cute. lesbian wedding, chicken breasts."
2,11,rachel:, oh god. i think i'm gonna be sick.
2,11,monica:, why? it's not like i'm putting little nipples on them.
2,11,ross:, and you had no idea they weren't getting along?
2,11,rachel:, none.
2,11,joey:, they didn't fight a lot?
2,11,rachel:," no! they didn't even talk to each other. god, how was i supposed to know they were having problems?"
2,11,phoebe:," in my day, divorce was not an option."
2,11,joey:," hey, look who's up."
2,11,rachel:," i just can't believe this is happening. i mean, when i was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. i just figured as a grownup i wouldn't have to worry about this."
2,11,monica:," is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? i mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you."
2,11,rachel:," well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?"
2,11,chandler:," you know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. but in your case it's actually kinda true."
2,11,phoebe:, that's him.
2,11,chandler:, phoebe?
2,11,phoebe:," oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting."
2,11,phoebe:," oh, no, please, i spent most of mid morning trying to stand up. now uh, what can i do for you, my dear?"
2,11,phoebe:," you're saying, my wife is in you?"
2,11,phoebe:," well, i don't know what to tell you dear. the only thing i can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything."
2,11,phoebe:, everything.
2,11,phoebe:," oh, wait, i remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time."
2,11,phoebe:, look at this.
2,11,rachel:," oh, look, here's barry. did he have to come straight from the office?"
2,11,rachel:," no, that was his costume. see, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist."
2,11,monica:," um, you guys, you know when i said before, ""thank you, but i don't really need your help""?"
2,11,rachel:," actually, what i think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."""
2,11,monica:," really? weird. anyway, see, i planned everything really well. i planned and i planned and i planned. it just turns out, i don't think i planned enough time to actually do it."
2,11,rachel:," hey, mon, you want some help?"
2,11,monica:, if you want.
2,11,phoebe:," hey. what a day. i took her everywhere. the museum of modern art, rockefeller center, statue of liberty."
2,11,rachel:, she's still with you?
2,11,phoebe:," this is so much fun, just the girls. you know what we should do? does anybody have any marijuana?"
2,11,rachel:, god!
2,11,monica:," that's fine. i never did it. i just thought i might. so, what's new in sex?"
2,11,rachel:, the only man i've ever been with is your father.
2,11,monica:," i mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but i was thinking there might be more."
2,11,rachel:, no.
2,11,rachel:, no.
2,11,rachel:, i guess i just figured of all people you would understand this.
2,11,rachel:, you didn't marry your barry. i did.
2,11,rachel:, oh.
2,11,monica:," all right people, we're in trouble here. we've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. move, move, move!"
2,11,chandler:," monica, i feel like you should have german subtitles."
2,11,monica:," joey, speed it up!"
2,11,joey:," i'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!"
2,11,phoebe:," monica, how did this happen? i thought you had this all planned out."
2,11,monica:, do you want me to cry? is that what you want? do you wanna see me cry?
2,11,phoebe:, sir! no sir!
2,11,monica:," all right, you!"
2,11,ross:," no. look, i told you i am not a part of this thing."
2,11,monica:," all right, look, ross. i realize that you have issues with carol and susan, and i feel for you, i do. but if you don't help me cook, i'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and i'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in ross"". all right, ball the melon."
2,11,chandler:," hey! how come i'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. "
2,11,monica:, hi.
2,11,carol:, how's it going?
2,11,monica:, it's goin' great. right on schedule. got my little happy helpers. 
2,11,carol:," fine, whatever."
2,11,ross:, what's the matter?
2,11,carol:," nothing. ok, everything. i think we're calling off the wedding."
2,11,ross:, what?
2,11,monica:," you're still gonna pay me, right? or something a little less selfish."
2,11,ross:," carol, what's the matter? what happened?"
2,11,carol:, my parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
2,11,ross:, oh my god.
2,11,carol:," i mean, i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. they're supposed to give me away and everything."
2,11,ross:, it's ok. i'm sorry.
2,11,carol:," and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if i couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. i don't know what to do."
2,11,ross:," i uh can't believe i'm gonna say this, but i think susan's right."
2,11,carol:, you do?
2,11,ross:," look, do you love her? and you don't have to be too emphatic about this."
2,11,carol:, of course i do.
2,11,ross:," well then that's it. and if george and adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. look, this is your wedding. do it."
2,11,carol:, you're right. of course you're right.
2,11,monica:, so we're back on?
2,11,carol:, we're back on.
2,11,monica:," you heard the woman. peel, chop, devil! i can't believe i lost 2 minutes. "
2,11,joey:," it just seems so futile, you know ? all these women, and nothing. i feel like superman without my powers, you know? i have the cape, and yet i cannot fly."
2,11,chandler:," well now you understand how i feel every single day, ok? the world is my lesbian wedding. "
2,11,phoebe:, 
2,11,carol:, thank you.
2,11,ross:, any time. 
2,11,carol:, ross. 
2,11,minister:," you know, nothing makes god happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. friends, family, we're gathered here today to join carol and susan in holy matrimony."
2,11,phoebe:, 
2,11,monica:, would you look at them?
2,11,ross:," yeah, can't help but."
2,11,joey:, i wrapped those bad boys.
2,11,phoebe:, i miss rose. 
2,11,chandler:," oh, yeah? "
2,11,phoebe:," i know it's kind of weird, but i mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now i just feel kind of alone."
2,11,woman:," you know, i uh, i couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and i think it's time for you to forget about rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?"
2,11,phoebe:," ok, that's so nice. "
2,11,chandler:, 
2,11,rachel:," oh, am i! i just danced with a wonderfully large woman. and three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. oh, i'm not saying it's something i wanna pursue, but it's nice to know i have options."
2,11,rachel:," there's more alcohol, right? "
2,11,susan:, how you doin'?
2,11,ross:, ok.
2,11,susan:, you did a good thing today.
2,11,ross:, yeah.
2,11,susan:, you wanna dance?
2,11,ross:," no, that's fine."
2,11,susan:, come on. i'll let you lead.
2,11,ross:, ok. 
2,11,chandler:, 
2,11,monica:," ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?"
2,11,ross:," well, mon, i was married."
2,11,phoebe:," yeah, me, too, technically."
2,11,rachel:, i had a wedding.
2,11,monica:," all right, just trying to start an interesting discussion."
2,11,joey:, i got one. which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? 
2,11,chandler:, isn't ben in this?
2,11,all:," oh, yeah!"
2,12,ross:, that commercial always makes me so sad.
2,12,joey:," yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out ok."
2,12,ross:, i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel.
2,12,phoebe:," i can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin."
2,12,monica:, and the fact that they're both monkeys.
2,12,ross:," sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing, ya know, giving him away."
2,12,rachel:," oh, ross, you had to, i mean, he was humping everything in sight. i mean, i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding."
2,12,ross:," remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it."
2,12,chandler:," yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. when i did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden i have this big attitude problem. opening titles "
2,12,joey:," hey, hey, check it out, guess what i got."
2,12,chandler:, rhythm?
2,12,joey:," no, my first fan mail."
2,12,all:, alright!
2,12,monica:," 'dear dr. remore, know that i love you and would do anything to have you.' gosh. 'your not so secretive admirer, erica ford.' ooh wait, 'ps enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'"
2,12,rachel:," ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married."
2,12,monica:," this wasn't addressed to days of our lives, this is, this came to your apartment. there's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building."
2,12,joey:," oh my god, i got my very own stalker. "
2,12,ross:, hey guys.
2,12,all:, hey.
2,12,phoebe:," ooh, where are you off to, travelin' jake?"
2,12,ross:," well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in l.a. so i figured i'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel."
2,12,chandler:," you know i think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion. [rob enters]"
2,12,rachel:," oh, phoebe, that really cute guy is here again."
2,12,phoebe:," oh, oh, ok, so everyone, pretend like i'm telling you a story, ok. and, and it's really funny. so everyone just laugh, now. "

2,12,rob:, hi. i'm rob dohnen.
2,12,phoebe:, hi rob dohnen.
2,12,rob:," i don't know anything about music, but i think you're really, really great."
2,12,phoebe:," oh, wow."
2,12,rob:," anyway, i schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and i was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?"
2,12,phoebe:," oh, i would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that i will write for them. "
2,12,joey:," hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?"
2,12,chandler:, well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. 
2,12,chandler:, hello.
2,12,erica:, it's erica.
2,12,joey:," ah, the stalker."
2,12,erica:," never mind, it's open."
2,12,chandler:," yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. we might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon."
2,12,joey:, let's get out of here. 
2,12,chandler:, the one time they're not home.
2,12,joey:," ok, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met."
2,12,chandler:, that's how radio stars escape stalkers.
2,12,joey:, she's comin'. 
2,12,erica:, it's me.
2,12,joey:," uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. ready?"
2,12,chandler:," wait, wait, wait. [joey opens the door and sees erica . joey gets a huge smile and chandler squeezed the dish soap in the air.]"
2,12,erica:, hi.
2,12,joey:, erica. 
2,12,lipson:," hi, dean lipson, zoo administrator. i was told you had a question."
2,12,ross:," well, i uh, i can't seem to find the monkey i donated last year. he's a capuchan, answers to the name marcel."
2,12,lipson:," ahh, i'm afraid i have some bad news. marcel has passed on."
2,12,ross:," oh my god, what happened?"
2,12,lipson:," well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died."
2,12,ross:, i can't believe this.
2,12,lipson:," i'm sorry mr. geller. but ya know, there's an old saying, 'sometimes monkeys die.' it's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today."
2,12,ross:," well, ya know, someone should have called me."
2,12,lipson:," i'm sorry. look, i know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture."
2,12,ross:, zoo dollars?
2,12,lipson:," yes, and come see the bird show at 4. the macaws wear hats. well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died. "
2,12,kids:, ooohhh.
2,12,phoebe:, i know.
2,12,monica:," i can't believe joey's having lunch with his stalker. what i , what is she like."
2,12,chandler:, yeah.
2,12,chandler:," well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
2,12,rachel:, and she's not crazy?
2,12,chandler:," oh no no no, she's a total wack job. yeah, she thinks that joey is actually dr. drake remore."
2,12,rachel:, oh my god.
2,12,monica:," ah, and i mean, he's going out with her? he can not persue this."
2,12,chandler:," hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. i mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? what're you lookin' at me for? he's the one who wants to boff the maniac."
2,12,rob:, you ok?
2,12,phoebe:," no, uh uh, i'm just, i'm nervous. so, you know what, maybe if i just, if i picture them all in their underwear."
2,12,rob:," that's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired."
2,12,phoebe:," i'm just, i'm, i'm, i'm used to playing for grown ups. ya know, they just, grown ups drink their coffee and do their grown up thing, ya know, and kids listen. this is a huge responsibility. what? are you gonna kiss me?"
2,12,ross:, i was thinkin' about it.
2,12,phoebe:," ok. ok, alrighty, let's play some tunes. hi everybody, i'm phoebe"
2,12,all:, hi phoebe.
2,12,phoebe:," ok, um, i'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, ok. "
2,12,erica:," oh, drake, isn't it amazing?"
2,12,joey:, yeah it is. . . what?
2,12,erica:," well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord."
2,12,joey:," yeah, that was a tricky one. in reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites."
2,12,erica:, who's they?
2,12,joey:, no one.
2,12,erica:," oh drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh i could just eat them. . . but i won't."
2,12,joey:," good, otherwise my watch would fall off. "
2,12,erica:," no, seriously. these hands. these miracle, magical, life giving hands. oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?"
2,12,joey:," alright, just one. "
2,12,waiter:," oh my god! someone, he's choking. is anyone here a doctor?"
2,12,erica:," well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of salem, dr. drake remore. "
2,12,janitor:, meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
2,12,ross:," uhh, hey look, i don't really enjoy being with other men that way. but, um, zoo dollars?"
2,12,janitor:, it's about your monkey. it's alive. 
2,12,erica:," i don't understand, why didn't you help that man?"
2,12,joey:," uhh, cause, uhh, i'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. alright, look, i got to tell you something."
2,12,erica:," no, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. you don't have to explain yourself to me. ooh, who am i to question the great dr. drake remore?"
2,12,joey:, but that's what...
2,12,erica:, i should just be happy to be near you.
2,12,joey:, hey i 
2,12,erica:, hey what?
2,12,joey:," that's it, just hey. like at the end of a dance, hey! "
2,12,phoebe:," there'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . but don't. cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody that's another thing that you don't wanna do."
2,12,monica:, excellent!
2,12,chandler:, very informative!
2,12,rachel:, not at all inappropriate!
2,12,phoebe:, thank you for coming everybody. there're cookies in the back.
2,12,rob:," that was great, the kids loved you."
2,12,phoebe:," yay, i rock."
2,12,rob:," and you know why? because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.you were incredible."
2,12,phoebe:, but.
2,12,rob:, how did you know there was a but?
2,12,phoebe:, i sense these things. it was either but or butter.
2,12,rob:," the thing is, i think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals."
2,12,phoebe:, i can do that.
2,12,rob:, really?
2,12,phoebe:, yeah.
2,12,rob:, because that would be fantastic. what? you wanna kiss me?
2,12,phoebe:, thinkin' about it. 
2,12,janitor:," ahh, the bat. ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe."
2,12,ross:," buddy, my monkey?"
2,12,janitor:," oh, yeah, right. there was a break in, few months back, inside job. your monkey was taken."
2,12,ross:, oh my god. but the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
2,12,janitor:, the zoo! do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
2,12,ross:," that, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
2,12,janitor:, of course they're gonna say he's dead. they don't want the bad publicity. it's all a great big cover up. do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
2,12,ross:, that guy lipson?
2,12,janitor:, lipson knows. do you have any idea who else knows?
2,12,ross:," no, i, i only know lipson."
2,12,janitor:," hmm, lipson knows huh? ahh, hello mr. opossum, enigma of the trees, upside down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with..."
2,12,ross:," buddy, my monkey, my monkey."
2,12,janitor:," word on the street well, when i say street, i mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo."
2,12,ross:, of course.
2,12,janitor:," your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. that's all i know."
2,12,ross:, this is unbelievable.
2,12,janitor:," so, what is this information worth to you, my friend?"
2,12,ross:, are you trying to get me to bribe you?
2,12,janitor:, maybe.
2,12,ross:, but you already told me everything. 
2,12,ross:," check it out, he actually is the monkeyshine monkey."
2,12,rachel:," well, so what're you gonna do?"
2,12,ross:," well, i guess i'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is."
2,12,chandler:, that's what i did when i lost my clydesdales.
2,12,phoebe:," ok, hi again."
2,12,all:, hi phoebe.
2,12,phoebe:," damnit, i'm a doctor, i'm not god."

2,12,joey:, somebody wanna help me out here?
2,12,rachel:," oh, i know, i know. "
2,12,erica:," how, how can you be here and there."

2,12,joey:, i'm not drake.
2,12,ross:," that's right, he's not drake, he's hans remore, drake's evil twin."
2,12,erica:, is this true?
2,12,rachel:," yes, yes it is true. and i know this because, because he pretended to be drake to, to sleep with me. "
2,12,monica:," and then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. "
2,12,chandler:," and you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. "
2,12,erica:, is all this true?
2,12,joey:," yes, i'm afraid it is. you deserve much better than me erica. you deserve to be with the real drake, he's the one you fell in love with. go to salem, find him, he's the guy for you."

2,12,joey:," ok, alright, the people who threw the water. "
2,12,phoebe:, fired! why?
2,12,rob:, the library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
2,12,phoebe:, i can't believe it. did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
2,12,rob:, no.
2,12,phoebe:, i see.
2,12,rob:, maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
2,12,phoebe:," no. what do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?"
2,12,rob:, i'm not saying you have to be barney.

2,16,chandler:," i know, this is a great apartment."
2,16,joey:," ah, i was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. so when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the rockettes."

2,16,phoebe:," i don't believe this. is this how this relationship's gonna work? ross equals boss. i mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?"
2,16,rachel:, what's 1922?

2,16,joey:," i'm sorry. i'm 28 years old, i've never lived alone, and i'm finally at a place where i've got enough money that i don't need a roommate anymore."
2,16,chandler:," woah, woah, woah. i don't need a roommate either, ok? i can afford to live here by myself. ya know, i may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware."
2,16,joey:," what're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? it's not like we agreed to live together forever. we're not bert and ernie."
2,16,chandler:," look, you know what? if this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."

2,18,phoebe:," uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?"
2,18,chandler:," no he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room."
2,18,phoebe:," maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. let's remedy that, shall we?"
2,18,chandler:, we don't need to remedy that.
2,18,phoebe:," oh yeah, it'll be fun. "

2,18,joey:," hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?"
2,18,joey:," uh, well, kinda yeah. like, remember last week when alex was in the accident? well the line in the script was, 'if we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' but i made it, ' if this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'"
2,18,phoebe:," ohh, ok, i see what you did there. aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?"
2,18,joey:," huh? never really thought about the writers. the scripts just kinda come to my house. but you know what? this makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that? "
2,18,writer:," makes up most of his lines. son of a . yeah, well, write this jerkweed. "
2,18,joey:," uhh, i don't know, i just bring the scripts."
2,18,joey:, right. could you sign this?
2,18,joey:, i don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
2,18,joey:," well it wasn't that many guys. i mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage."
2,18,rachel:," hey, it's not that big a deal, i was just curious."
2,18,ross:, g'night.
2,18,richard:," alright, before i tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with."

2,18,richard:," well, i mean what can i say? i, i was married to barbara for 30 years. she was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two."
2,18,monica:," woah, woah, no wait a minute now. c'mon it's your turn. oh c'mon. ya know, i don't need the actual number, just a ballpark."
2,18,monica:," ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark. "
2,18,rachel:," wow, i am so glad i'm not monica right now."
2,18,ross:," tell me about it. so what, what's your magic number?"
2,18,rachel:," well, there's you."

2,18,ross:," oh yes, the weenie from torrini."
2,18,rachel:," oh honey, are you jealous of paolo? oh, c'mon, i'm so much happier with you than i ever was with him."
2,18,ross:," oh please. that paolo thing was barely a relationship. all it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head. "
2,18,chandler:," eddie, i didn't sleep with your ex girlfriend."
2,18,eddie:," that's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say."
2,18,chandler:," this is nuts. this is crazy. she came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story."
2,18,eddie:, where's buddy?
2,18,chandler:, buddy?
2,18,eddie:," my fish, buddy."
2,18,chandler:, there was no fish when she dropped it off.
2,18,eddie:, hey i didn't kill your fish. look eddie...

2,18,monica:," oh, yay. ok about that two."
2,18,richard:," what? alright, what about my two?"
2,18,monica:," well, it just seems like a really small number."
2,18,richard:," right, and..."
2,18,monica:," and, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? or is that what you're doing with me? oh my god, am i an oat?"
2,18,richard:," honey, you are not an oat. i, i mean i don't know, i, i guess i'm just not an oat guy. i've only slept with women i've been in love with."
2,18,monica:, but you've only slept with two people.
2,18,richard:, right.
2,18,monica:," wow. oh wow. you know i love you too, right."
2,18,richard:," ross, ross, please listen to me. ross, you are so much better for me than paolo ever was. i mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh."
2,18,ross:," oh, hey, if i make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and i'll just stand in the corner and tell knock knock jokes."
2,18,rachel:," animal sex, animal sex? so what're you saying, i mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. i mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?"
2,18,rachel:," ok, ross, try to hear me. ok, i, hey, i'm not gonna lie to you. ok, it was good with paolo."
2,18,ross:, knock knock.
2,18,rachel:," but, what you and i have is so much better. ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. ya know, i swear, this is the best i have ever had."
2,18,ross:, until now.

2,20,rachel:," two, two babies?"
2,20,ross:," yeah. ya know, a boy and a girl. hopefully the girl will come first so ben here won't feel too competitive."
2,20,rachel:, then what's gonna happen?
2,20,ross:," well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, scarsdale."
2,20,rachel:, uh huh.
2,20,ross:," yeah, that way i figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. and yes, i know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, nassau county but the school system's supposedly great."
2,20,rachel:," wow. wow, that's great. great. ok, wow, you know what."

2,20,richard:, ok. 
2,20,monica:," oh, why does this bother me so much? i mean i don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them."
2,20,phoebe:," it's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and i don't know, what do i do?"
2,20,phoebe:, does it matter? you're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
2,20,rachel:, aghh.
2,20,phoebe:, me too. 
2,20,monica:, i've got a question. richard made plans again with the guys.
2,20,rachel:," ya know what, i think i'm gonna go to my room and read cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. know what, at least maybe i can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover cristmas candles."
2,20,ross:," ok, what the hell happened back there?"
2,20,rachel:," well i'm sorry, i think about stuff. ya know, i mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders."
2,20,rachel:," ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks."
2,20,ross:," yes, but i, i think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next saturday night. i do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. you know what our childrens names are gonna be."
2,20,ross:," no, no, i mean, ya know, i, i read a book and there was a girl named emily and i thought, i thought that might be good."

2,20,rachel:," ok, ross, ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing."
2,20,ross:, yeah.
2,20,rachel:," but i do not want to have everything decided for me. i spent my whole life like that. it's what i had with barry, that was one of the reasons i left. i, i like not knowing right now and i'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that."
2,20,ross:, ok fine.
2,20,rachel:, thank you.
2,20,ross:, we're not done.
2,20,rachel:," ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that."
2,20,rachel:," fine, i will."
2,20,ross:," good, 'cause i love you."
2,20,rachel:, oh yeah.

2,20,phoebe:," oh yeah. you know, i don't know if i was happier when um george bailey destroyed the family business or um, donna reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed."
2,20,monica:," i didn't watch the ending, i was too depressed. it just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""it's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."" "
2,20,chandler:," but... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... bam! yes! could that shot be any prettier?"

2,21,rachel:," yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping."
2,21,rachel:," ok, so phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?"
2,21,phoebe:," i, i don't wanna meet my father over the phone. what am i gonna say, like 'hi, i'm phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. oh, by the way, i broke your dog.'"
2,21,joey:," hey phoebs, if you want, i'll do it."

2,21,chandler:,"well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle. "
2,21,joey:," hey, this is ridiculous. i'll tell you what. after i get back from my neice's christening, i'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. no problem, joey's there."
2,21,chandler:, ok.

2,21,phoebe:, oh.
2,21,frank:, except stilts.
2,21,phoebe:, stilts?
2,21,frank:," yeah, he loved stilts. one time i was upstairs, i was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden i look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. he just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts."
2,21,phoebe:, wow.

2,22,monica:, you wanna be in charge of the food committee?
2,22,ross:, question two. why do we always have to have parties with committees?
2,22,joey:, really. why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
2,22,ross:," yeah, i agree. ya know, i think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and i'm just not sure we are."
2,22,monica:," alright. if you guys don't want it to be special, fine. you can throw any kind of party you want. honk honk."
2,22,chandler:," wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns. opening titles "

2,22,monica:," woah, woah, woah, uh, no shannon cooper."
2,22,phoebe:, why not her?
2,22,joey:," cause she uh, she steals stuff."

2,22,monica:," hey i liked her, alright. maybe, maybe too much. i don't know i guess i just got scared."
2,22,phoebe:," i'm sorry, i didn't know."

2,22,rachel:," agh, it was the graduation from hell."
2,22,chandler:," ya know, i mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. my sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. it's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica."
2,22,monica:, so what happened?
2,22,rachel:," ok, so i guess we don't invite her parents."
2,22,monica:," well, how bout just her mom?"

2,22,rachel:," sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. you've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father."
2,22,rachel:, did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. i felt like gulliver around that place.

2,22,chandler:," ya know, i just, so weird. i mean i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july."
2,22,chandler:, becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
2,22,rachel:," it's just this thing. every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. my sister jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. but then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. it never occured to anybody to bring another one. and now it's just..."
2,22,chandler:," i, i know. "
2,22,monica:," alright, monica dear, i'm gonna hit the road. now i've left my 10 verbs on the table. and you be sure and send me that finished poem."

2,23,phoebe:," oh ok, ryan, that guy i went out with, who's in the navy. "
2,23,rachel:, you went out with a guy in the navy?
2,23,phoebe:," yeah, i met him when i was playing guitar in washington square park. ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change."
2,23,joey:," hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?"
2,23,phoebe:," so wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time? "
2,23,monica:, that'll teach you to lick my muffin.
2,23,ross:, hiii.
2,23,joey:," oh no, what happened?"
2,23,ross:," well, i just spoke to carol. ben's got the chicken pox."
2,23,all:, oh no.

2,23,rachel:, well i've had it.
2,23,joey:," yeah, i've had it."
2,23,monica:, had it.
2,23,chandler:, had it.
2,23,phoebe:," honey, you made the bed again. i told you, you don't have to do that. this isn't camp."
2,23,richard:," ooh, then i guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. ok, i am going to take a shower and today i will be singing jim crochee's leroy brown. "
2,23,richard:," monica... hey mon, i have a question. is leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?"
2,23,monica:, baddest. otherwise the song would be fat fat leroy brown.
2,23,richard:, what're you doing?
2,23,monica:, just waiting for you sweetie.
2,23,richard:, are you remaking the bed?
2,23,monica:," i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you know what, the way you did it was just fine."
2,23,richard:," if i tell you, you'll think i'm crazy."
2,23,richard:, you're pretty much running that risk either way.
2,23,monica:," oh, well that's not so crazy."
2,23,monica:, i'm just easing you in.
2,23,richard:," oh, alright."
2,23,monica:," alright, you see these little flower blossoms? they should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. you don't love me any more do you."
2,23,richard:," really? wow, well then come on, i wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. "
2,23,chandler:," hey, look joey, i'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, i can get you a job right here as an entry level processor."
2,23,joey:, but don't you need experience for a job like that?
2,23,chandler:," it's not that hard to learn. and as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. act like a processor, people will think you're a processor."
2,23,scott:," hey chandler, here's this morning's projections."
2,23,chandler:," hey thanks. scott alexander, joey tribbianni. joey is a uh, fellow processor."
2,23,scott:," oh yeah yeah. i process. people want the processing, i'm the one they call."
2,23,scott:, where do you work?
2,23,joey:," uhh, well, right now i'm in between things. you know how it is. one day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more."
2,23,chandler:, i was just telling joey about the opening in fleischman's group.
2,23,scott:," fleischman's group. whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. ha ha ha..."
2,23,joey:, ha ha. 
2,23,rachel:," oh, this lipstick looks just great on you."
2,23,monica:," you look fabulous honey, you really do."
2,23,phoebe:," you see, you look beautiful. for god sakes, dim the lights."
2,23,phoebe:, it's gonna be ok. ryan's been under water. he's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt. 
2,23,phoebe:, come in.
2,23,ryan:," hey baby, i'm back... "
2,23,phoebe:," hey ryan, what's up?"
2,23,ryan:," well, no no, you have to stay back. i, i have the pox."
2,23,ryan:, chicken or small?
2,23,phoebe:, chicken. which is so ironic considering i'm a vegetarian.
2,23,ryan:, why aren't you at home in bed?
2,23,phoebe:," 'cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my god, i forgot how cute you are."
2,23,ryan:," i'm sorry, i never had 'em."
2,23,phoebe:," if i had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when i was 7, when jimmy hauser had the chicken pox. i would grab that kid and rub him all over my face."
2,23,phoebe:," yeah, or you know, you could just wish that i didn't have them now."
2,23,ryan:, can i please see your face?
2,23,phoebe:, nope. you don't want to see a face covered with pox.
2,23,ryan:," your face could be covered with lochs, i wouldn't care."
2,23,phoebe:," and you hate fish. oh. that's so sweet, alright. ok, alright, you can see. this is me... oh, i am scary."
2,23,ryan:," i hate this. 'cause i tell you, i had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything i had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this."
2,23,ryan:," phoebe, i have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. i am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. "
2,23,phoebe:," ok, this is the most romantic disease i've ever had. "
2,23,joey:, hey.
2,23,chandler:," hey, how's the first day goin'?"
2,23,joey:, pretty good. it's like you said. it's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
2,23,chandler:, well there you go.
2,23,joey:," hey and everbody is so nice. i just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, jeannie."
2,23,chandler:," yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. small world huh?"
2,23,chandler:, i figure my character has kids.
2,23,chandler:," well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. my character, joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, ashley and brittany. ashley copies everything brittany does."
2,23,chandler:," yeah. joseph and his wife, karen, are thinking of having a third kid... ya know what? just did."
2,23,chandler:, really? wow. that's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there. 
2,23,ryan:, you know what makes the itching even worse?
2,23,phoebe:, that you don't stop talking about it.
2,23,ryan:, fine.
2,23,phoebe:," let's just play, ok. good, ok. here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice..."
2,23,ryan:, what're you doing? are you scratching?
2,23,phoebe:," no. this is what i do for luck, ok."
2,23,ryan:, you're scratching. give me the dice.
2,23,phoebe:, no.
2,23,ryan:, give me the dice.
2,23,phoebe:," no. here. there. ooh, double sixes."
2,23,ryan:," we can't scratch. you know we can't, we'll scar."
2,23,phoebe:," uhh, i can't stop thinking about it. it's just so hard. i just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. "
2,23,ryan:, no.
2,23,phoebe:, give it.
2,23,ryan:, no.
2,23,phoebe:," yeah, come on. you know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. "
2,23,ryan:, oh god help me.
2,23,phoebe:," now do me, do my back. oh come on, harder. "
2,23,rachel:," oh, stop that, stop that right now."
2,23,ross:," you know, i might have expected this of you phoebe, but ryan, you're a military man. "
2,23,joey:," you and milton have to join us on the boat. karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
2,23,jeannie:," oh, that sounds lovely. we're gonna have to set that up. oh, i better get back. hope the baby feels better."
2,23,joey:, bye bye joey.
2,23,joey:, what a phony.
2,23,chandler:," well, i'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. hey mr. douglas."
2,23,joey:," uh, listen bing, i received your memo. so, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next friday?"
2,23,chandler:," i have a family, i'm gonna be here."
2,23,joey:," yeah bing, what's that about?"
2,23,chandler:, rough numbers?
2,23,joey:, have the final numbers on my desk by tuesday.
2,23,chandler:," uh, if you say so sir."
2,23,joey:," joseph's good, isn't he?"
2,23,chandler:," well, i'm going to kill you."
2,23,joey:," hey, hey, i just figure joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
2,23,chandler:, why?
2,23,joey:," look, i'm sorry but that's what joseph does, ok. if you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'what're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say. "
2,23,richard:," ooh, duct tape. was i supposed to bring something too?"
2,23,monica:, this is for the scratchy twins out there. i taped oven mits to their hands.
2,23,richard:, you're strict.
2,23,monica:," exactly. oh, i love that i can be totally neurotic around you now. tell me the truth. don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?"
2,23,richard:," if it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle."
2,23,monica:, very good.
2,23,richard:, thank you.
2,23,monica:, you know what. tomorrow i'm gonna do your clocks.
2,23,richard:, you're gonna do what to my clocks.
2,23,monica:, i'm gonna set them to my time.
2,23,richard:," no no. see, in my bedroom i set my clock six minutes fast. you wanna know why?"
2,23,richard:, because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
2,23,monica:," no forget it, i'm not gonna tell you now."
2,23,richard:, no come on. come on tell me.
2,23,monica:, no. see you don't understand.
2,23,richard:, come on.

2,23,richard:, no that's not true. that is not true.
2,23,monica:, oh yeah.
2,23,richard:, yeah.
2,23,monica:," alright, well tell me one of yours."

3,3,ross:, hey.
3,3,chandler:, noo.
3,3,chandler:," okay, i accept that. when janice asked me and i said no, she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow. "
3,3,rachel:," okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it."
3,3,chandler:," okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her...."

3,3,ross:, and it works both ways.
3,3,chandler:," okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
3,3,rachel:," well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on."
3,3,ross:," okay, for instance. let's say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. which do you do?"
3,3,chandler:," that's easy, baggage claim."
3,3,ross:," wrong! now you're single. it's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. that way she knows you love her."
3,3,chandler:," okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know i'm all for. but, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. so, uh, how do i tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something."
3,3,rachel:," oh honey, i'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. okay, i'm late for work."
3,3,ross:, oh.

3,3,ross:, i'm gonna use the cushion.
3,3,chandler:, yeah.
3,3,ross:," okay, you're in bed. she's over on your side, cuddling. now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. and then you rollll a way. hug for her! roll for you."
3,3,chandler:," okay, the old hug and roll."
3,3,ross:, yep.
3,3,chandler:," okay, one question."
3,3,ross:, shoot.
3,3,chandler:, you're pretending the pillow's a girl right?

3,3,phoebe:," okay, first i'm not crazy. and second, say it don't spray it. anyway his name is malcom, and he wasn't following me, i mean he was, but 'cause he thought i was ursula, ick. and, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'cause of the restraining order."
3,3,chandler:," umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom."
3,3,phoebe:," ooh! no, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. he's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. and we just get along really well, and he's so cute."
3,3,ross:," oh my god, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker."
3,3,phoebe:," no, i'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de ursula ized', like you know, like i did for joey after he went out with her."

3,3,ross:, what?
3,3,rachel:, are you serious?
3,3,monica:," yeah. the great thing about the jam plan was, i was taking control of my life. so i asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when i came up with the baby plan. "
3,3,ross:," well, aren't you forgetin' something? what, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? dad!"
3,3,monica:," it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with, if i have to wait another 28 years then, i'll be 56 before i can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
3,3,chandler:," that, that's what's stupid."

3,3,chandler:," pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
3,3,phoebe:, what are you saying i should do?
3,3,monica:," i think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
3,3,phoebe:," thank you, monica."
3,3,joey:," orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
3,3,monica:," oh, that's what i would do, forget mine. "
3,3,rachel:," oh my god, what happened? "
3,3,janice:," oh. god, crazy chandler. he spun me...off...the...bed!"

3,3,phoebe:," um, perhaps. yes! yes, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister."

3,3,phoebe:," oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. just walkin' along looking like me. what, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?"
3,3,malcom:," i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i tried to stop, but i couldn't. i'm so pathetic."
3,3,phoebe:," no, no, it's not your fault. you know it's partly my fault, 'cause i made you quit cold turkey. sorry, no. okay, well, i mean, i can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know wow! but um, but i will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. okay, stalk me for a while. huh? yeah, and, and, and, i'll be like an ursula patch."

3,3,joey:," no, i i figured you would've picked a blond guy."
3,3,monica:, really? why?
3,3,joey:," i don't know, i just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... hoyt."
3,3,monica:, hoyt?
3,3,joey:," it's a name, yeah. i saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool."
3,3,monica:," really, is he a swimmer?"
3,3,joey:, he's got the body for it.
3,3,monica:, i like that. what?
3,3,joey:," 'we don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know."
3,3,monica:, we do not have one of those signs.

3,3,joey:," oh monica. wow, this guy's an astronaut. that would've been cool, for like a day. . closing credits "
3,3,joey:," i called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of tribianni. nobody wants my product. i mean, i i i don't get it maybe if they met me in person."

3,3,rachel:, yeah.
3,3,ross:, hello. 
3,3,rachel:, hello.
3,3,ross:," hey. uh, chan, can i uh, can i talk to you for a second?"
3,3,chandler:, sure. what's up?
3,3,ross:," just one uh, one additional relationship thought. probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! "
3,4,host:," welcome everybody, welcome to amazing discoveries!"
3,4,phoebe:," oh, oh! it's on again!"
3,4,joey:," you guys, can we please not watch this all right."
3,4,all:, shhhh!
3,4,host:," folks, has this ever happened to you. you go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin' flangin' hard to open."
3,4,joey:," oh, you said it mike. aw! there's got to be a better way!"
3,4,mike:, and there is kevin.
3,4,joey:, can we please turn this off?
3,4,rachel:," noo way, kevin."
3,4,mike:, there is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. meet the milk master 2000.
3,4,ross:, are you intrigued?
3,4,chandler:, you're flingin' flangin' right i am!
3,4,mike:," keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. go ahead. this works with any milk carton."
3,4,joey:," wow, it is easy. now, i can have milk everyday. opening credits "
3,4,chandler:," well, it's official there are no good movies."
3,4,janice:," well, let's go to a bad one and make out. "
3,4,monica:," perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back."
3,4,joey:, hey!
3,4,phoebe:, hey.
3,4,chandler:," hey, man. what's up?"
3,4,joey:, maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at the audition i didn't know i had today. the first good thing she gets me in weeks. how could you not give me the message?!
3,4,chandler:," well, i'll tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
3,4,phoebe:," yes, it was! it was him! uh huh! okay, it was me! "
3,4,joey:, how is it you?
3,4,phoebe:," well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. i mean, chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and i hadn't found a place to hide yet. i i i meant to tell you, and i wrote it all down on my hand. see, all of it. "
3,4,joey:," yep, that's my audition."
3,4,monica:," see, now this is why i keep notepads everywhere."
3,4,phoebe:," yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."
3,4,janice:, what is the great tragedy here? you go get yourself another appointment.
3,4,joey:," well, estelle tried, you know. the casting director told her that i missed my chance."
3,4,phoebe:, that is unfair. i'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
3,4,joey:," pheebs, you can't do that. the casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents."
3,4,phoebe:," what a sad little life she must lead. okay, ooh . "
3,4,joey:," what, what are you doing? what are you doing?"
3,4,phoebe:," no, no, no, i know, i know, ooh. 'hi, this is katelynn, from phoebe buffay's office. um, is um, ann there for phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'"
3,4,joey:," hang up, hang up. "
3,4,phoebe:," 'annie! hi. listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office? estelle, no, i don't know what i'm going to do with her. no. all right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'"
3,4,chandler:, is anybody else scared?
3,4,phoebe:," 'right, well look, um, if joey loses this audition, that is it for estelle. i don't care! annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' i need a pen. "
3,4,chandler:, get the woman a pad! get the woman a pad! a pad! a pad!
3,4,monica:, hey!!
3,4,ross:," there's my boy! here's my boy! and here's his barbi what's ah, what's my boy doing with a barbi?"
3,4,carol:," he picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it."
3,4,susan:," he carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret."
3,4,ross:," yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. why, why, why does he have it, again?"
3,4,susan:, so he's got a doll? so what? unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
3,4,carol:," this doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?"
3,4,ross:," you know what it's fine. if you're okay with the barbi thing, so am i. "
3,4,ross:," give daddy the barbi! ben, give, give me the barbi. okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? no. okay, oh, oh, how about a dino soilder? "
3,4,rachel:," ross, you are so pathetic. why can't your son just play with his doll? "
3,4,monica:, i gotta go to work. has anybody seen my left boob?
3,4,joey:, i love that movie. 
3,4,monica:," there it is. joey, what are you doing?"
3,4,joey:," i'm sorry, it just felt nice."
3,4,chandler:, joe. joe! answer the phone.
3,4,joey:," hey, i only got one good arm, you know. you should be doing stuff for me. go get me a sweater."
3,4,chandler:," just do it! okay, it's janice and if i get it i'm going to have to see her tonight. oh, that's great i'm gonna have to see her tonight."
3,4,rachel:, what's the big deal? why don't you wanna see janice?
3,4,chandler:," okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
3,4,ross:," and that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"
3,4,chandler:, noo.
3,4,ross:," you didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you."
3,4,chandler:, 'run for your life! get out of the building!'
3,4,rachel:, men are unbelievable.
3,4,monica:," what is it with you people! i mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?"
3,4,chandler:," i know, that, that's why i don't want to go tonight, i'm afraid i'm going to say something stupid."
3,4,monica:," oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you."
3,4,joey:," hey, you know about that?!"
3,4,chandler:," look what do i do? i wanna get past this, i don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. i wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! "
3,4,ross:, where there is no fear of commitment.
3,4,chandler:, do we have any... do we have any thoughts here?
3,4,joey:," well, i've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as i understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. but, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. it have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! if you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. right. in this case, you have a fear of commitment, so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was."
3,4,rachel:," amazingly, that makes sense."
3,4,chandler:, you think?
3,4,joey:," oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!"
3,4,chandler:," yeah, joe, i assure you if i'm staring down the barrel of a gun, i'm pretty much peeing every which way. "
3,4,phoebe:," oh, it's your audition from this morning. can i use the phone again?"
3,4,rachel:," sure pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents."
3,4,joey:," come on baby, come on!"
3,4,phoebe:," 'hi, i have phoebe buffay returning a page. okay, well, um, she's in her car i'll have to patch you through.'"
3,4,rachel:, very nice touch.
3,4,phoebe:," 'okay, go ahead.' um, hi annie. fantastic! you got it. oh, okay, um, 'will he work for scale?' you ask me. well, i don't know about that, except that i do and he will. great, oh you are such a sweetheart. i would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... op, went through a tunnel."
3,4,rachel:, unbelievable.
3,4,joey:, thank you so much.
3,4,phoebe:," it was really fun, i mean i've never talked on a car phone before."
3,4,joey:," you were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that i really, really want, and estelle couldn't get me in."
3,4,phoebe:," oh, i don't know. i mean it was fun one time."
3,4,joey:," come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
3,4,phoebe:, two?
3,4,joey:," yeah! well, well really it's three. please. you're so good at it. i love you."
3,4,phoebe:," okay, i'll do it, but just these three, right"
3,4,joey:," nooo, four. "
3,4,janice:," so, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?"
3,4,chandler:," 'cause, i wanted to uh, give you this. "
3,4,janice:," ohhh, are you a puppy! contact paper! i never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper."
3,4,chandler:," well, wait there's, there's more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. see, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
3,4,janice:," oh, you didn't have to do this."
3,4,chandler:," yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get. "
3,4,janice:," well, i gotta buy a vowel. because, oh my gawd! who, would've thought that someday, chandler bing would buy me a drawer."
3,4,chandler:," well, not me. but that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. we should take a trip."
3,4,janice:, we should?
3,4,chandler:," yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. and, i wanna meet your parents. we should take a trip with your parents!"
3,4,janice:," i don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! are you okay?"
3,4,chandler:," i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that i'm here it's like what was the big deal. i could probably say 'let's move in together.' and i'd be okay."
3,4,janice:, you probably want us to move in together?
3,4,chandler:, it doesn't scare me!
3,4,janice:," yeah, well, it scares me! i mean i not even divorced yet, chandler. you know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. and, and i wasn't even that hungry. you know what, it's getting a little late, and i i should just, um... "
3,4,chandler:," oh, no, no, no, don't go! i've scared ya'! i've said too much! i'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! hey, janice! it's me. um, yeah, i i i just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. commercial break "
3,4,rachel:," honey, this will help. "
3,4,chandler:, uff.
3,4,monica:, that is never good.
3,4,chandler:, then i got all needy and clingy.
3,4,rachel:," okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it's not so bad. how did you leave it?"
3,4,chandler:, ohh! 
3,4,chandler:, oh god.
3,4,monica:, welcome to our side of the tunnel.
3,4,chandler:, this ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
3,4,rachel:," yeah, well that's that lo cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. we sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases."
3,4,monica:," you know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low fat."
3,4,rachel:," yeah, you do."
3,4,chandler:," so, you don't think i'm terminal?"
3,4,monica:," well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control."
3,4,chandler:, nooo!
3,4,rachel:," this is a very critical time right now. if you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. you want her back you have to start acting aloof."
3,4,monica:, she has to know that your not ready.
3,4,rachel:," right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. and then act aloof."
3,4,chandler:," so i'm not, not gonna lose her?"
3,4,rachel:," oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
3,4,chandler:," i said, 'so i'm not gonna lose her?'"
3,4,rachel:, oh. 
3,4,ross:," guess who's here. it's the toughest guy in toy land, ben. 'a real american hero. i'm g.i. joe!' drop the barbi, drop the barbi."
3,4,rachel:, g.i. joe? do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
3,4,joey:, g. i. joe! cool! can i play?
3,4,ross:, go joe!!!
3,4,phoebe:, helloo! oh!

3,4,joey:," look listen, that tv movie i went in for? did you hear anything? i think i got a shot at it."
3,4,phoebe:," yes! they called and you didn't get it! okay, i mean you didn't get it, i'm sorry, i'm sorry."
3,4,joey:," it's okay, these things happen."
3,4,phoebe:," but they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. oh god, i don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
3,4,joey:," i'm, i'm okay. see. "
3,4,phoebe:," oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. you know what, i, i'm sorry i quit, okay, i just quit."
3,4,joey:," no! no, no you can't quit! you're the best agent i ever had! look pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
3,4,phoebe:," not personal, really, well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent."
3,4,joey:, they actually said that?
3,4,phoebe:," yeah. ooh god, there's that face again! see i can't do this job! i..."
3,4,joey:," no, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. you know, estelle just says stuff like 'they went another way', but this, i can use this. i canna work on a new accent."
3,4,phoebe:," yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. yeah."
3,4,ross:," you'll never get me, joe!!! "
3,4,janice:," no, thank you. chandler!"
3,4,chandler:," hello, janice."
3,4,janice:, what are you doing here?
3,4,chandler:," oh, just a bit of shopping. how've you been?"
3,4,janice:, are you being british?!
3,4,chandler:, no. not anymore.
3,4,janice:, why are you shopping here? you don't live in this neighborhood. were you here waiting for me?
3,4,chandler:," yeah, huh. i'm just uh, you know i'm just picking up some things for a party. "
3,4,janice:, barley? what kind of party serves barley?
3,4,chandler:," well, i'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
3,4,janice:, where is this party?
3,4,chandler:, here in chelsea.
3,4,janice:, who's party is it?
3,4,chandler:, a woman's
3,4,janice:, what woman?!
3,4,chandler:, chelsea.
3,4,janice:," okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. so like which of these two guys do you want to be? "
3,4,chandler:, can i be that guy? 
3,4,phoebe:," okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. "
3,4,joey:," okay, shoot."
3,4,phoebe:," okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
3,4,joey:, i didn't get it?
3,4,phoebe:," no. they said you 'weren't believable as a human being.' so, you can work on that. "
3,4,joey:," okay, what else?"
3,4,phoebe:," um, the off broadway play people said 'you were pretty but dumb.'"
3,4,joey:, oh.
3,4,phoebe:," oh no wait, i'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
3,4,joey:," look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, i really appreciate this pheebs, but i think i'm gonna have to go back to estelle."
3,4,phoebe:, oh.
3,4,joey:," yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her i don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
3,4,phoebe:," yeah, no, i understand."
3,4,joey:," you do, thanks."
3,4,phoebe:, yeah. sorry. 
3,4,joey:, wait a minute.
3,4,phoebe:, what?
3,4,joey:," wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent."
3,4,phoebe:," oh, you caught me. i am so busted."
3,4,joey:, that's ah what i suspected ah. 
3,4,chandler:," ....and then i just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store."
3,4,monica:," my god! chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
3,4,chandler:," i've actually ruined this haven't i? it's time for the good ice cream now, right?"
3,4,rachel:," yeah, it is."
3,4,monica:," you know what, everything's gonna be okay. "
3,4,chandler:," hello. hi, janice! can you hold on for a second? okay. okay, what do i do?"
3,4,rachel:," shhh...i don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
3,4,monica:, if if if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
3,4,rachel:, yeah.
3,4,chandler:, hello!
3,4,monica:," oh wait, you know what, i got it, i got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. be sleepy."
3,4,rachel:," yes, and grumpy."
3,4,chandler:," what are you, stop naming dwarves! hello, janice. hi, i'm so glad that you called, i know i've been acting a really weird lately. and, it's just because i'm crazy about you, and i just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. i'm sorry. really?! really?!"
3,4,rachel:," he's soo lucky, if janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now."
3,4,chandler:, i love you too.
3,4,monica:," aw, it's soo unfair. "
3,4,carol:, g. i. joe. g. i. joe?!
3,4,ross:," hey, i don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose."
3,4,susan:," what'd you do, dip it in sugar?"
3,4,ross:," look, g. i. joe's in, barbi's out. and if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'"
3,4,monica:," what are you being such a weenie for? so he has a barbi, big deal. you used to dress up like a woman."
3,4,ross:, what?
3,4,monica:," well, you used to dress up in mom's clothes all the time."
3,4,ross:, what are you talking about?
3,4,monica:," the big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag."
3,4,ross:," okay, you are totally making this up."
3,4,monica:, how can you not remember? you made us call you...bea. 
3,4,ross:, oh god.
3,4,susan:, i've literally never been this happy.
3,4,monica:, wasn't there a little song?
3,4,carol:," oh please god, let there be a song."
3,4,ross:, there was no song. there was no song!
3,4,monica:, 'i am bea.'
3,4,ross:, okay.
3,4,monica:, 'i drink tea.'

3,7,ross:, well mr. big shot is better than ''wethead'. 
3,7,joey:," okay, some tricks of the trade. now, i've never been able to cry as an actor, so if i'm in a scene where i have to cry, i cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. or ah, or, let's say i wanna convey that i've just done something evil. that would be the basic ''i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it' okay, let's say i've just gotten bad news, well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13. and that's how it's done. great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."

3,7,rachel:," okay, look, ross, i realise that my father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here."
3,7,ross:," look sweetie, i could be the bigger man, i could be the biggest man, i could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that i could pick your father up and say ''like me! like me tiny doctor!'"
3,7,rachel:," okay, well can't you just try it one more time ross? for me? for me?"
3,7,ross:," rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. you gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along."

3,9,joey:, come on man! you never want to do anything since you and janice broke up.
3,9,chandler:, that's not true! i wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. i wanted to start drinking in the morning. don't say that i don't have goals!
3,9,joey:," chandler, you have to start getting over her. all right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you ''cause the teams won't be even. come on."
3,9,chandler:," yeah, all right, i'll play."
3,9,phoebe:, yay!!
3,9,rachel:, let's do it! ross?
3,9,ross:, what?
3,9,rachel:, do you wanna play football?
3,9,ross:," um, monica and i aren't supposed to play football."
3,9,joey:, yeah.
3,9,monica:," well, every, every thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ''geller bowl.'"
3,9,chandler:," no, no, no, you say that proudly."
3,9,monica:," anyway, ross and i were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, geller bowl vi, i accidentally broke ross's nose."
3,9,ross:," it was soo not an accident. she saw i was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. and just keep running."
3,9,monica:," to score the winning touchdown, by the way."
3,9,ross:," whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking."
3,9,monica:, i won the game.
3,9,ross:, oh yeah! then how come you didn't get the geller cup?
3,9,rachel:," um, there was a geller cup?"
3,9,ross:," yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. but our dad said, ''nobody won that game, '' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake."

3,10,phoebe:," no, no, i am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. hey, how do you sleep at night?"
3,10,joey:," well, i'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. hey, phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. those trees were born to be christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
3,10,phoebe:, really? 
3,10,chandler:," yes. yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see new york. "
3,10,gunther:," ...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray...."
3,10,rachel:," gunther, gunther, please, i've worked here for two and a half years, i know the empty trays go over there. "
3,10,gunther:, what if you put them here. 
3,10,rachel:," huh. well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too."
3,10,gunther:, they already do. that's why they call it the ''tray spot.'
3,10,rachel:," gee, i always heard them talk about that, i just always thought that it was a club they went to. oh god, i'm, i'm sorry. "
3,10,gunther:, it's all right. sweetheart. 
3,10,ross:," so, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? i mean, your dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore. "

3,10,ross:," wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
3,10,sarah:," yeah. my dad says if i spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as i do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the taj mahal."
3,10,ross:, i think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india.
3,10,sarah:," no. the one in atlantic city, dad loves the slots. he says he's gonna double the college money my grandma left me."
3,10,ross:," huh. well, good luck to dad. say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?"

3,10,ross:," well, that makes sense."
3,10,sarah:," could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?"
3,10,ross:," yeah, sarah, anything."
3,10,sarah:," could you pull open the curtains for me? the astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a tv, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so i could watch it. "
3,10,woman:, yesss?
3,10,ross:," hi, i'm selling brown bird cookies."
3,10,woman:," you're no brown bird, i can see you through my peephole."
3,10,ross:," no, hi, i'm, i'm an honorary brown bird "
3,10,woman:, what does that mean?

3,10,woman:," i can dial 9 1 1 at the touch of a button, y'know. now, go away!"
3,10,ross:," no, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to spacecamp more than anything in the world."

3,10,phoebe:," you keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
3,10,joey:, well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
3,10,phoebe:," so, what happens to the old guys?"
3,10,joey:," well, they go into the chipper."

3,13,joey:," well, safer. y'know, i mean i never start reading the shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know."
3,13,rachel:, how often do you read it?
3,13,joey:, haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
3,13,rachel:," well, umm, i guess i read little women more than once. but i mean that's a classic, what's so great about the shining?"
3,13,joey:, nothing. all right? this is like the scariest book ever. i bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
3,13,rachel:," okay. ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. i will read the shining, and you will read little women. "

3,13,richard:," ew, this feels very weird."
3,13,monica:, you touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
3,13,richard:," yeah, well, sure i touch them, but i spent years learning not to squish them. that's my hand."
3,13,monica:, oops.
3,13,richard:, okay.

3,13,monica:," why not?! i mean this has been the most amazing week. would it be so terrible? even if we were friends who lived together. or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever."
3,13,richard:," wow. y'know we're back where we were. honey, i would love to do all that, but nothing's changed."
3,13,monica:," that's not true, you don't have a moustache."
3,13,richard:," okay, okay, one thing's changed. but we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end."
3,13,monica:," y'know what, i've got to walk out of here right now, ''cause getting over you is the hardest thing that i have ever had to do. i don't think i could do it again."

3,14,monica:," wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?"
3,14,phoebe:," well, yeah. y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our moms worked on the barge together."
3,14,monica:," oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge."

3,14,monica:," yeah, ginger something."
3,14,joey:," nooo. no, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like ginger, like ah, gingeer?"
3,14,monica:," no, it was ginger. i remember, because when he told me, i said, ''the movie star.'"
3,14,joey:," aww, man. that's the girl i was hiding from. when she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what i did."
3,14,monica:," well, what did you do?"
3,14,joey:," what, oh, oh, oh, no, no, i can't, i can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing i've ever done my whole life."
3,14,monica:," y'know what, don't tell us. we'll just wait until chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way."
3,14,joey:," all right!! okay, it was like four years ago. okay, ginger and i had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her dad's cabin. just me, her, and her annoying little dog pepper. well that night, i cooked this really romantic dinner...."
3,14,monica:, you gave her food poisoning!?
3,14,joey:," i wish. no. after dinner, me, her, and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out. so, i picked up a log and threw it on. or, at least what i thought was a log."
3,14,phoebe:, oh my god!! you threw pepper on the fire!
3,14,joey:," i wish. see, i guess another thing i probably should've told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg. "
3,14,monica:," oh my god! joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?"
3,14,joey:, i ran!! 
3,14,chandler:," well, that's the best kiss i've had with anyone i've ever met in a men's room."
3,14,ginger:," actually, me too."
3,14,chandler:," op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle."
3,14,ginger:," oh damn, i hate that."
3,14,chandler:," yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
3,14,ginger:," oh, don't worry about it."

3,14,rachel:," okay, well if i stop playing with joey and chandler, can i play with mark?"

3,14,monica:," okay, well i do know you."
3,14,phoebe:, that's what i said.
3,14,monica:, well so?
3,14,phoebe:," i can't. i can't. she dumped me, i mean i totally trusted her and then one day it was ''okay, bye pheebs' gone. y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun i've ever had in like all my lives. "
3,14,leslie:," my best shoes, so good to me. i wear them everyday. down at the heel, holes in the toes. don't care what people say. my feet's best friends, pals to the end. with them i'm one hot chicky. though late one night, not much light, i.... "

3,14,lecturer:, we're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. for instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....

3,14,rachel:, oh. 
3,14,phoebe:," smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault."
3,14,leslie:," wow, that's great."
3,14,phoebe:," oh, yeah!"
3,14,leslie:," y'know you could totally sell this. it'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign."
3,14,phoebe:," i..., a jingle? no, no no no, no."
3,14,leslie:, what? why not? you could make a ton of money.
3,14,phoebe:," okay, well if i was in this for the money, i'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. you just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie."
3,14,leslie:," aw, you're right, you're right. i'm sorry."
3,14,phoebe:," that's okay. all right, i'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. it's called magician box mix up. "
3,14,lecturer:," ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now. "
3,14,monica:, hi!
3,14,chandler:, hey.
3,14,monica:," oh, can i borrow this? my milk's gone bad."
3,14,chandler:," oh, i hate that. i once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."

3,14,chandler:," great. it was great. she's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness."
3,14,monica:," sounds like she's got the ah, whole package."
3,14,chandler:," joey told you about the leg, huh?"
3,14,monica:, uh huh.
3,14,chandler:," oh god, it freaked me out. okay, i know it shouldn't have, but it did. i mean i like her, i don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like ''hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' i mean i'm the smallest person in the world aren't i? i'm the smallest person in the world."
3,14,joey:, morning.
3,14,chandler:, actually he's the smallest person in the world.
3,14,joey:, heard about the leg burnin' huh?
3,14,chandler:, it came up.
3,14,joey:," listen, i ah, i know it's a longshot. but, by any chance did she find that funny? "
3,14,ross:, so i nodded off a little.
3,14,rachel:, nodded off!! ross you were snoring. my father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
3,14,ross:, come on! forty five minutes! forty five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
3,14,rachel:," well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to professor pitstains and he's ''hey everybody! remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'"
3,14,ross:," first of all it's professor pittain! and second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly."
3,14,rachel:," blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah, blah, blah."
3,14,ross:," y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what i do, i wonder how many people would go see a movie called, jurassic parka."
3,14,rachel:," oh, that is so..."
3,14,ross:," no no no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. "
3,14,rachel:," y'know if what i do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? huh? was it so i just wouldn't go with mark?"
3,14,ross:," no. i... i wanted to be with you. i don't know, i feel like lately, i feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. with this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. i i i know it's dumb, but i hate that i'm not a part of it."
3,14,rachel:," it's not dumb. but, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. y'know what i mean? i mean it's like, i i i like that you're not involved in that part of my life."
3,14,ross:, that's a little clearer.
3,14,rachel:," honey see, it doesn't mean that i don't love you. because i do. i love you, i love you so much. but my work it's it's for me y'know, i'm out there, on my own, and i'm doing it and it's scary but i love it, because it's mine. i, but, i mean is that okay?"
3,14,ross:," sure, i i i... "
3,14,ginger:, your thinking about my leg aren't you?
3,14,chandler:," no. no. actually i forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
3,14,ginger:, ''how much it bothers you?' because i don't like wasting my time. am i wasting my time?
3,14,chandler:, no. no. i don't think so.
3,14,ginger:," okay. it's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it. "
3,14,ginger:, what's that?
3,14,chandler:, that's that's my nubbin.
3,14,ginger:, what's a nubbin?
3,14,chandler:," it's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing."
3,14,ginger:, you have three nipples?
3,14,chandler:," well, y'know two regulars. and ah one that barely qualifies as... ahh, what?"
3,14,ginger:," nothing. i, i just remembered i have to leave."

3,14,phoebe:," okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay"
3,14,leslie:," i played smelly cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts."
3,14,phoebe:," no, look, i told you that i didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. god, y'know what, i think five years ago i probably would've done anything to play with you but, i can do it by myself. and if i can't trust you then just forget it. "
3,14,leslie:," no, no, i don't want to forget it."
3,14,phoebe:," okay y'know what you have to choose. all right, if if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have smelly cat, but we won't be partners. so what's it gonna be? "
3,14,commercial:," problem odour in the litter box? don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter. "
3,14,monica:," sorry, pheebs."

3,16,monica:, hello! organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
3,16,phoebe:, they have the best stuff in there. 
3,16,chandler:, oh my god! oh my god!
3,16,joey:," yeah. we figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with rachel. which is probably what you shoulda done. huh?"
3,16,ross:," you think?! god, i, ah, i'm in hell. i mean what, what am i gonna do? rachel's all like, ''i love you and, and let's work on this.' and all i can think about is, ''what is she gonna do? what is she gonna say?' when i tell her what i did."
3,16,chandler:," well, before we answer that, i think we should address the more important question. how dumb are you?"
3,16,ross:," what?! look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. how am i supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?"
3,16,joey:," look, ross look, i'm on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble."
3,16,chandler:," he's right. nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her."
3,16,joey:," yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild."
3,16,ross:," yeah, but don't you think...."
3,16,chandler:," all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. and that's what deathbeds are for."
3,16,ross:," yeah, okay. "
3,16,joey:," all right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. did you think about the trail?"
3,16,ross:, what trail?
3,16,joey:, the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! you always have to think about the trail!
3,16,ross:," oh, i i don't think there's any trail."
3,16,chandler:," okay, okay okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issac's sister is jasmine. and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe. and phoebe's friends with rachel. and that's the trail, i did it! "
3,16,phoebe:," after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one, "
3,16,monica:, did that!
3,16,phoebe:, grasp one of the linen strips by its ''easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
3,16,monica:, okay. ow!!!!! ow oh oh!
3,16,phoebe:, was it not pain free?
3,16,monica:," no. it was painful. oh my god , they should call it pain zine, now with a little wax."
3,16,phoebe:," huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad."
3,16,monica:," that's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. but hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest."
3,16,phoebe:, ow ow ow ow! oh my god!!!
3,16,monica:," now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips? "
3,16,ross:, chloe? hi.. 
3,16,chloe:, is this about me taking your watch?
3,16,ross:, you took my watch?
3,16,chloe:," i'm sorry, i do that."
3,16,ross:," just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?"
3,16,chloe:," oh no. i feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know."
3,16,ross:," exactly. so you didn't, didn't mention anything to issac right?"
3,16,chloe:," oh, well i tell issac everything."
3,16,ross:," you tell, of course you do. issac. issac. hey, issac. issac, hi! y'know we haven't actually met..."
3,16,issac:, you dog!
3,16,ross:," yes, i suppose i am a dog. but issac, see i i happen to have a girlfriend."
3,16,issac:," oh right, that rachel chick from the coffee place."
3,16,ross:," yeah, that's the one. listen, i don't want to hurt her."
3,16,issac:," oh, hey, man i know, doesn't matter how much we love ''em, monogamy is too cruel a rule."
3,16,ross:," yeah. listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"
3,16,issac:," aw, no problem dude. y'know we got to look out for each other. we're the same, you and me."
3,16,ross:," actually, no, we're not."
3,16,issac:," yeah, we are."
3,16,ross:," no, we're not."
3,16,issac:," yeah, we are."
3,16,ross:," no, we're not!!"
3,16,issac:," okay, we're not."
3,16,ross:, right.
3,16,issac:," but, we are."
3,16,ross:, fine. i just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
3,16,issac:, i can promise not to tell her again. 
3,16,ross:, jasmine? 
3,16,jasmine:, uh huh.
3,16,ross:," we met at phoebe's birthday party, i'm, i'm ross geller."
3,16,jasmine:, you did a bad thing!
3,16,ross:," yes, i did."
3,16,jasmine:, very bad!
3,16,ross:, very bad.
3,16,jasmine:," very, very bad."
3,16,ross:," i'm agreeing with you. did you, listen, did you happen to tell phoebe yet?"
3,16,jasmine:, no.
3,16,ross:," okay, jasmine, please, please don't. i love my girlfriend very much, and i want more than anything to just work it out with her. okay?"
3,16,jasmine:, all right.
3,16,ross:," thank you, thank you."
3,16,jasmine:," but you should probably talk to my roommate, because i told him and he knows phoebe too."
3,16,ross:, who's your roommate? 
3,16,ross:," gunther! gunther. gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place."
3,16,gunther:, i'm sorry. was i not supposed to? commercial break

3,16,chandler:, off?!!
3,16,phoebe:," for your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience."
3,16,chandler:," yeah, well i don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely."
3,16,joey:," yeah, i i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. i mean, come on, it's just a little wax."
3,16,phoebe:," oh yeah, come here. "
3,16,chandler:," oh, that's mature."
3,16,joey:," okay, fine, so now what, i just pull it off?"
3,16,phoebe:, uh huh.
3,16,monica:, that's right. 
3,16,ross:," come on, rachel, come on! talk to me! please!! "

3,16,ross:," listen. oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!"
3,16,rachel:, and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! 
3,16,ross:," look, i didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. i thought we were broken up. "
3,16,rachel:, we were on a break!
3,16,ross:," that, for all i knew would, could last forever. that to me is a break up."
3,16,rachel:, you think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
3,16,ross:," look, i'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. i thought our relationship was dead!"
3,16,rachel:," well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake! "
3,16,joey:," y'know what, i don't think we should listen to this anymore. "
3,16,monica:," what, what are you doing? you can't go out there."
3,16,joey:, why not?! i'm hungry.

3,16,ross:," come on! like i wanted him to tell you, i ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!"
3,16,rachel:," oh, that is so sweet. i think i'm falling in love with you all over again. "
3,16,chandler:," y'know what, i think we can go out there. i mean they have more important things to worry about."
3,16,joey:," yeah, we'll be fine. "
3,16,ross:," look rachel, i wanted to tell you, i thought i should, i i did, and then chandler and joey convinced me not to. "
3,16,chandler:," wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever. "
3,16,phoebe:," hi, it's phoebe. listen someone's gonna have to take my 9 with mr. rehack, ''cause it's like 9 now, and i'm not there. "
3,16,ross:, don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if i didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with mark?
3,16,rachel:, all right. let's say i had slept with mark. would you have been able to forgive me?
3,16,ross:, yes i would.
3,16,rachel:," you'd be okay if you knew that mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?"
3,16,ross:, yes.
3,16,rachel:," you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...."
3,16,ross:," la la la la la la la la la la! okay, okay, yeah, i would have been devastated but, i would still want to be with you. because it's, i mean it's you. "

3,16,chandler:, are you actually saying these words? 
3,16,ross:," what, now you're not even taking to me? look rachel, i i'm sorry, okay, i'm sorry, i was out of my mind. i thought i'd lost you, i didn't know what to do. come on! come on, how insane must i have been to do something like this? huh? i i don't cheat right, i, that's not me, i'm not joey! "
3,16,joey:," whoa ho ho! yeah, okay."
3,16,monica:, hey. it's three in the morning. they don't know that i've come home yet. you notice how neither one of them are wondering where i am.
3,16,phoebe:," yeah, y'know, people can be so self involved. "
3,16,ross:," y'know what, y'know what, i'm i'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. you're the one that bailed on us. you're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!"
3,16,rachel:, that's....
3,16,ross:, that's what?!
3,16,rachel:, that is neither here nor there.
3,16,ross:," okay, well here we are. now we're in a tough spot again, rach. what do you want to do? how do you want to handle it? huh? do you wanna fight for us? or, do you wanna bail? look, i, i did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. okay? and i'm sorry, i wish i could take it back, but i can't. i just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. rachel, i love you so much. "
3,16,rachel:," no ross!! don't! you can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? it doesn't work that way. it doesn't just make it better. okay?"
3,16,ross:," okay, okay, okay."
3,16,rachel:, i think you should go.
3,16,ross:, what?
3,16,rachel:, i really think you need to go now.
3,16,ross:," okay, okay. this morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together..."
3,16,rachel:," yeah, what the hell did i know!"
3,16,ross:," look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. okay, i can't imagine, i can't imagine my life without you. without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. your good heart rach, and, and...."
3,16,rachel:," no. i can't, you're a totally different person to me now. i used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. god, and now i just can't stop picturing with her, i can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, ross. it's just changed, everything. forever. "
3,16,ross:," yeah, but this can't be it, i mean. "

3,17,chandler:," yeah y you, how hard is it to say something? rachel came over to borrow something."
3,17,joey:, anyway! her and ross just started yelling at each other.
3,17,phoebe:, wait. why was he yelling at her? he's the one who slept with someone else. 
3,17,joey:," well, i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now."
3,17,phoebe:," whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. oh my god, this is like 60 minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."
3,17,chandler:," y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. man, i hope ross doesn't try to kidnap me after cub scouts."
3,17,phoebe:," y'know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together, they never broke up. and we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."

3,17,carol:," oh god, ross i am so sorry."
3,17,ross:," yeah, well."
3,17,carol:," y'know what, i want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?"
3,17,ross:," oh yeah, i'd love that."
3,17,carol:," oh, great! me too."
3,17,ross:, i guess it all started when rachel got this new job. 
3,17,phoebe:," okay, yeah. triple a can pick us up."

3,17,phoebe:," okay. we are at a rest stop on route 27. okay. there is no route 27. okay, either 93 or 76?"
3,17,rachel:," i don't know, i'm sorry, i always slept in the back when we drove up here."
3,17,phoebe:," okay. hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? okay! yeah, no they don't do that."
3,17,rachel:," ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
3,17,monica:," who? i mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? i think we should call ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
3,17,rachel:," no! no, i am not getting in a car with ross, we will just have to live here! "
3,17,phoebe:, but if...
3,17,rachel:," no you guys, i am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else."
3,17,phoebe:," oh good, oh joey and chandler are back. "
3,17,monica:, so the going for help went well?
3,17,joey:," oh yeah, smokey joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."
3,17,chandler:, i have the lung capacity of a two year old. 
3,17,monica:, then why are you smoking?
3,17,chandler:, well it's very unsettling. 
3,17,ross:," ....right? right? i mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, i mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. y'know i don't, i don't need them, huh, i've got you guys now as friends, you and susan."

3,17,carol:," no. but it's okay, i'll just put out pickles or something. "
3,17,phoebe:," ross, thank god."
3,17,ross:," pheebs? what, why are you whispering?"
3,17,phoebe:, i ate a bug. 
3,17,monica:," hey rach, the tampons here are only a penny. let's stock up. "
3,17,phoebe:," listen ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck."
3,17,ross:," oh, now you want a favour?"
3,17,phoebe:," yes, please."
3,17,ross:," well, oh, i'm sorry your car broke down pheebs, but i'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?"
3,17,carol:," phoebe, hang on a second. here, take my car, go pick up your friends."
3,17,ross:," no, i'm not gonna pick them up."
3,17,carol:," listen, we both know you're gonna do it ''cause you're not a jerk. okay? so you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car."
3,17,ross:," no, rachel doesn't want me to...."

3,19,phoebe:," wow. so, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over ross yet and you have issues with your father."
3,19,rachel:, i don't have any issues with my father.
3,19,phoebe:," okay, so it's probably just the ross thing then. "
3,19,joey:," i hate this woman!! i hate her! she told everyone in the company about that info mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. okay, and whenever i can't do it, they're all like like laughing at me."

3,19,rachel:, y'know what?
3,19,mark:, no. and i don't think i'm gonna want to.
3,19,rachel:, i can't do this.

3,19,pete:, just tell me the truth.
3,19,monica:," okay. umm, y'know, i don't think, i don't think i told you this, but umm, i just got out of a really serious relationship."
3,19,pete:," oh, yeah. wasn't that like a year ago?"
3,19,monica:," so i did tell you. okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. umm, the thing is that, right now i'm just in a place in my life where i need to focus on me. y'know what i mean?"
3,19,pete:," oh, yeah. i know that."
3,19,monica:, i so wanna be attracted to you.

3,19,monica:," well, um, look i i don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy i just told i wasn't attracted too."
3,19,pete:," yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? ''cause this place is kinda depressing. "
3,19,spokeswoman:, and the man who made all this possible... mr. peter becker.

3,20,chandler:, and is this in case the house sneezes?
3,20,phoebe:," no, no, that's the ghost for the attic."
3,20,monica:, i don't want a ghost.
3,20,phoebe:," well, nobody wants a ghost. but you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient indian burial ground."
3,20,ross:," wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient indian burial ground? that would never happen."
3,20,phoebe:," okay, obviously you don't know much about the u.s. government."

3,20,joey:, that guy's like a cartoon. what do you see in him anyway?
3,20,kate:, he happens to be brilliant. which is more than i can say for that sweater you're dating.
3,20,joey:," hey, i'm not interested in her sweater! it's what's underneath her sweater that counts. and besides, since ah, since when do you care who i'm going out with?"
3,20,kate:," i don't care. why, do you want me to care?"
3,20,joey:, do you want me to want you to care?
3,20,kate:, do you?
3,20,joey:," okay, i'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off. "

3,20,joey:, i don't know.
3,20,kate:," well umm, maybe if it had more heat."
3,20,joey:, how do you mean?
3,20,kate:," well, adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?"
3,20,joey:, maybe he could slip her the tongue.
3,20,kate:," or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up."
3,20,joey:," yeah, yeah, and then adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist."
3,20,kate:," and then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!"
3,20,joey:," and then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!"
3,20,kate:," and then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal.... "
3,20,joey:, something like that?
3,20,kate:," yeah, that's pretty much what i had in mind."
3,20,joey:, yeah. commercial break 
3,20,joey:, hey.
3,20,ross:, hi.
3,20,joey:, hey.

3,20,joey:," oh, it was so amazing. after the love making..."
3,20,monica:, oh my.
3,20,joey:," yep. i just, i just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. and then i knew she was dreaming ''cause, ''cause her eyes keep going like this. "
3,20,chandler:," i'm telling ya, joanna's got it all wrong. okay? all i said was, ''this was fun. let's do it again sometime. i'll give you a call.'"
3,20,rachel:," ohh, gee. i wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?"
3,20,chandler:, that's what you say at the end of a date.
3,20,rachel:," you can't just say, ''nice to meet you, good night?'"
3,20,chandler:," to her face? look it's the end of the date, i'm standing there, i know all she's waiting for is for me to say ''i'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. i can't help it, it's a compulsion."
3,20,monica:," come on rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. hasn't it ever happened to you?"
3,20,rachel:," well, they always called."
3,20,monica:," hmm, bite me. "
3,20,joanna:, did he call?
3,20,rachel:, no. sorry.
3,20,joanna:, why?! why?! he said he'd call. why hasn't he called?
3,20,sophie:," maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women."
3,20,joanna:," sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. why hasn't he called, rachel? why?"
3,20,rachel:," okay, okay. umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss."
3,20,joanna:, awkward? why should he feel awkward?
3,20,rachel:, well...
3,20,joanna:," the only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?"
3,20,rachel:, no. i...
3,20,joanna:," because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that. "
3,20,rachel:, call her! call her now!
3,20,chandler:," multiple, so many paper cuts."
3,20,rachel:," why hasn't he called rachel? why? why? i don't understand. why? he said he'll call. why? why? chandler i'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!"
3,20,chandler:," oh, well give me the phone then."
3,20,rachel:," come on, this isn't funny. she thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. you have to call her!"
3,20,chandler:," look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, ''in case you didn't notice, i don't like you!'"
3,20,rachel:, well then you're going to have to take her out again.
3,20,chandler:, nooo!! she's really dull! and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
3,20,rachel:," i don't care! i don't care! you are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. and, i don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
3,20,chandler:," all right! fine! but it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! and from now on i get my own dates, i don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!"
3,20,rachel:, that's fine!
3,20,chandler:," that's just a lot of big talk, y'know."
3,20,rachel:, i know.

3,20,joey:," what are you talking about? it was a big deal. i mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. i i was there, you're not that good an actress."
3,20,kate:," look umm, i, i was, i was just caught up in the moment. that's all it was. joey, i'm i'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?"

3,20,phoebe:," ohh, the the foster puppets! "
3,20,chandler:," it's not a big deal. it's, just it's right here, and it's all the time."
3,20,joanna:," well, thanks again for lunch."

3,20,chandler:," i'm sorry. i'm i'm i'm sorry that i said i was going to when i'm not. look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? and this isn't rachel's fault. it's me. i have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. i have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. and i'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out."
3,20,joanna:," well, this isn't how i was hoping how this would end, but i guess i have to appreciate your honesty."

3,21,phoebe:," ''cause you're still into monica. so you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ''cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
3,21,pete:, you're good. you're good!

3,24,joey:," yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. y'know? what you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?"
3,24,chandler:, what if joey were president? 
3,24,phoebe:," umm, hey rach, can i ask you something?"
3,24,rachel:, yeah.
3,24,phoebe:," okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if i set ross up on a date?"
3,24,rachel:," oh, ah with who?"
3,24,phoebe:," umm, my friend, bonnie. she just always thought ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if i could set it up, but if you're not cool with it..."

3,24,pete:," oh, believe me, i don't want to get hurt either. i'm being smart about this. see these guys? they're the best trainers in the world, and hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. a house painter! he used to be a house painter."
3,24,monica:, promise me you'll be careful.
3,24,pete:, i promise.
3,24,monica:," hey, are we still on for tonight?"
3,24,pete:, yeah.
3,24,monica:," okay, good, ''cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own..."
3,24,hoshi:, no! no boom boom before big fight!
3,24,monica:, how ''bout just a boom? 
3,24,rachel:," well that was depressing, i think i just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from fame. ready to go to the movies?"

3,24,bonnie:, thanks! you too. 
3,24,rachel:, you said she was bald.
3,24,phoebe:," yeah, she was bald, she's not now."
3,24,rachel:, how could you not tell me that she has hair?
3,24,phoebe:," i don't know, i hardly ever say that about people."
3,24,rachel:," ohh, well, this is just perfect!"
3,24,phoebe:," well i'm sorry, i thought you said it was okay."
3,24,rachel:," yeah, i said what was okay when i thought she was some weird bald chick. i mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!"
3,24,phoebe:," well, maybe it won't work out. maybe ross won't like her personality."
3,24,rachel:," why, does she have a bad personality?"

3,24,pete:, well i'm not gonna stop until i'm the ultimate fighting champion.
3,24,monica:, that guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
3,24,pete:," let me tell you a story. when i set out to create moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? no. there was moss 1, that burnt down my dad's garage, there was moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in january, and 862 others that i learned from, just like i learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck."
3,24,monica:, you didn't know that already?
3,24,pete:," look, i'm gonna get better. okay? i promise you."
3,24,monica:," okay, just get a lot better. fast."
3,24,pete:," oh, one other thing. hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration."

3,24,monica:, hey.
3,24,ross:, hey! how long until pete's fight?
3,24,monica:," oh, about five minutes. right now they're interviewing his opponent. apparently he trains by going to iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
3,24,ross:, hot dog?
3,24,monica:," four, please. i'm really nervous. thank you. "
3,24,phoebe:," so ross, how umm, how did it go with bonnie?"
3,24,ross:," what? oh! i gotta tell you, i i wasn't expecting to like her at all, i mean i actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific."
3,24,phoebe:," ohh, that's too bad!"
3,24,ross:," no, i i'm saying i liked her."
3,24,phoebe:," yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
3,24,ross:," pheebs, i think she's great. okay? we're going out again."
3,24,phoebe:," okay, i hear you! are you capable of talking about any thing else?"
3,24,chandler:, hey! which one's my turkey burger?
3,24,ross:," ahh, the one next to my foot. sorry."
3,24,joey:," hey, the fight's starting!"
3,24,ross:," okay, we'll be right in. so ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?"
3,24,chandler:," nine times! okay, i had to put on lotion! but, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow i'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
3,24,joey:, fight's over! 
3,24,chandler:," excuse me, doug? hey there sports fan!!"
3,24,doug:, bing! you got those numbers for me?
3,24,chandler:," no, i ah, i didn't do them."
3,24,doug:," oh, you forgot?"
3,24,chandler:," no, no i just ah, didn't do them. instead, i ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise."
3,24,doug:," well, i got tanked myself last night. pretty dicey drive home, tapanzi bridge never looked smaller. that's okay, you're still my number one guy! bing!"
3,24,chandler:, doug!!
3,24,doug:, hmm.
3,24,chandler:, i'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
3,24,doug:," oh, is it the swearing? i mean is it the constant swearing? because i gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!"
3,24,chandler:," no, no. it it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
3,24,doug:, oh?
3,24,chandler:," oh, and don't get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment. it's just that i, i have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous."
3,24,doug:," well, say no more. y'know it takes guts to bring this up. bing! you're okay."
3,24,chandler:, okay. 
3,24,doug:, ha! ahhhhhhh!
3,24,chandler:, ahhhhh! 
3,24,phoebe:," okay. would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?"
3,24,rachel:," oh my god! phoebe look, it's ross and that girl. "
3,24,phoebe:, no! no! look at that! it's a line of ants! they're working as a team!
3,24,rachel:, phoebe! 
3,24,phoebe:," right, oh yeah. wow, oh, it looks like ross is breaking up with her. uff, i hope he lets her down easy. let's go."
3,24,rachel:," come on phoebe, look at that! they are not breaking up, look at them. okay that's, you know what that is? that is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh..."
3,24,phoebe:," oh no! that really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive."
3,24,rachel:," ohh! phoebe, this is all your fault! now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
3,24,phoebe:, you said it was okay!
3,24,rachel:, you said she was bald!!
3,24,phoebe:, what?! what what what what what?!!
3,24,rachel:," phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! okay, we have to do something! we have to break them up! okay? just go in there and like, shave her head! you owe me one bald girl!!"
3,24,phoebe:," okay, first of all, breathe. second of all, i don't get it. aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with ross?"
3,24,rachel:, yes.
3,24,phoebe:, well isn't he your friend? don't you want him to be happy?
3,24,rachel:, yes.
3,24,phoebe:, so?
3,24,rachel:," i just y'know, i didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. ufff. ooo ooh! "
3,24,phoebe:, oh no.
3,24,rachel:, what?
3,24,phoebe:," oh, we killed them all."
3,24,rachel:, oh! 
3,24,pete:," it's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. ah, i'm not supposed to move my spine."
3,24,monica:, please tell me you're stopping now.
3,24,pete:," i'm fine! i'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. see this circle i'm marking off here? this is my zone of terror."
3,24,monica:, you are insane! you you gotta give this up!
3,24,pete:," i can't until i'm the ultimate fighter. i will do it. i'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or superman. now, i'm not saying i could beat superman, but y'know, kids are stupid."
3,24,monica:," sit down. all right? please, just listen to me. you are terrible at this! okay? you are the worst ultimate fighter ever! ever!! "
3,24,pete:," y'know i have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised adam's apple, but that really hurt."
3,24,monica:," well then, y'know what? i care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. so if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me."
3,24,pete:," well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone i'm not. i've got to do this."
3,24,monica:, then i've gotta go. bye. 
3,24,pete:, mon monica?
3,24,monica:, yes?
3,24,pete:," could you leave a note? ''cause i'm on a lot of pain killers now, and i don't know if i'll remember this tomorrow. "
3,24,doug:," so, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so i'm happy. great job team! tomorrow at 8 . phil! nice job. stevens! way to go! joel burg, you maniac! i love ya! bing! good job, couldn't have done it without ya. "
3,24,chandler:," thank you, sir."

3,24,chandler:," ye ye yeah, yes i do!"
3,24,doug:," pete becker is circling the ring now. it looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. oh, bruiser is just..."

3,24,all:, oh! oh! 
3,24,phoebe:," wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
3,24,ross:," well, this is ironic. of your last two boyfriends, richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now pete can't."
3,24,all:, ohh!! 
3,25,chandler:," so ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!"
3,25,bonnie:," all right, i was 15, it was my best friend, ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, i don't know, we were, we were making out."
3,25,chandler:, tell it again. seriously. 
3,25,rachel:, i mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
3,25,joey:," yeah, sure. well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography."
3,25,monica:," joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in."
3,25,joey:," well, i think we all learned something."
3,25,phoebe:," hey, you guys! look what i found! look at this! that's my mom's writing! look."
3,25,chandler:," me and frank and phoebe, graduation 1965."
3,25,phoebe:, y'know what that means?
3,25,joey:, that you're actually 50?
3,25,phoebe:," no no, that's not, that's not me phoebe, that's her pal phoebe. according to her high school yearbook, they were like b.f.f. best friends forever."

4,2,monica:," look, you and i went to different high schools..."
4,2,rachel:," okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school."
4,2,monica:," you went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made."
4,2,rachel:, they had to have that specially made?!
4,2,monica:, it was a project for one of the home ec classes.
4,2,rachel:," oh my god, they told us that was for the mascot!"
4,2,monica:," back then, i thought that i would never, ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews, and now he's he's called me up and asked me out. and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. i i owe her this. i never let her eat."
4,2,rachel:," oh, you go out with him. "
4,2,monica:," oh, really?!"

4,2,phoebe:," stop it! stop it! she keeps squirming, trying to get away! just like when she was alive."
4,2,ross:," so pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?"
4,2,phoebe:," well, i'm not sure. i mean, i guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. y'know, i think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. well, that's not gonna happen is it? noo. okay, i have to return a call in the other room."
4,2,monica:, why can't you use the phone in here?

4,2,chandler:," y'know, i, i really don't think we need a canoe."
4,2,tony:, you gotta take the canoe!
4,2,chandler:," all right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
4,2,peter:, we're not throwing it away! i built that canoe!

4,2,ross:," come here, here, come here, come here, mrs. buffay. sorry, about what i said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. when clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother."
4,2,phoebe:, thank you. we both forgive you.
4,2,rachel:," so honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?"
4,2,phoebe:," yeah, okay, listen, umm, mom, i hope you know you still mean a lot to me. and you're welcome to come back anytime."

4,3,monica:, how desperate am i?
4,3,rachel:," oh! good thing chandler's not here, he always wins at this game."
4,3,monica:, i just told my mom i'd cater a party for her.
4,3,phoebe:, how come?
4,3,monica:," because i need the money, and i thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self respect."
4,3,ross:," come on, i think this is a good thing. i don't think mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do."
4,3,monica:, you don't have to stick up for her. she can't here you. 
4,3,rachel:," hey! umm, do you guys have any juice?"

4,3,chandler:, no. no!
4,3,joanna:," hello, rachel. "
4,3,chandler:," well, not at first."
4,3,rachel:, what is she doing here? 
4,3,rachel:," i don't understand! last time you went out with her you said she was a ''big, dull dud.'"
4,3,chandler:," well, i think i judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level. "
4,3,rachel:," well, last time i almost got fired. you must end it, you must end it now!"
4,3,chandler:," oh, come on! it's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! i mean usually i'm pretty much just in there by myself. "
4,3,rachel:," chandler!! promise me, you will end it."
4,3,chandler:," okay, i promise, i'll end it."
4,3,rachel:, thank you.
4,3,chandler:," i hope you know what i'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what i mean."

4,3,monica:," ahh, that's what your grandmother's hands looked like when we found her."
4,3,monica:, hmm.
4,3,monica:," oh, well richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. then i heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, i assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. though, at least that would be something. "
4,3,monica:, oh my god! did you hear that? she hired me because she thinks i'm good.
4,3,phoebe:," okay, i didn't hear that."
4,3,monica:," oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks i'm good."
4,3,phoebe:," good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?"
4,3,joey:," do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? "
4,3,joey:," actually, i'm not buying. i'm selling. let me ask you one question. do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about? "
4,3,ross:," oh yeah, i totally agree. "
4,3,monica:, 'i think he deserves a nobel prize.

4,3,phoebe:, i'm not freaking out.
4,3,monica:," it's nothing, it's just that now your father owes me five dollars."
4,3,monica:," oh no, don't be silly. i just bet i'd need these. "
4,3,monica:, um hmm.
4,3,monica:," no no no, that was all true. this was just in case you pulled a monica."
4,3,monica:," oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself."
4,3,monica:," that's right. my mom doesn't have any faith in me! oh, that's hilarious! ha ha ha ha ha."

4,3,chandler:," i did break up with her! she just took it really, really well!"

4,6,chandler:," okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. "
4,6,ross:," i've seen her at work, but i always figured, ah huh? but, uh, i made her dinner. we had a great time. and we're going out again tomorrow. "
4,6,rachel:, well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek. 
4,6,ross:, fine by me; hope she wins. opening credits 
4,6,chandler:, hi. you guys have any wrapping paper? 
4,6,phoebe:, oo! is it for my birthday present? 
4,6,chandler:," phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago. "
4,6,phoebe:," yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet? "
4,6,chandler:," well, i have a call in about that. "
4,6,phoebe:, 'kay. 
4,6,chandler:," actually, this is for kathy's birthday. it's an early edition of her favorite book. "
4,6,rachel:," oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real! "
4,6,chandler:," okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. "
4,6,rachel:," huh. well, then you'd better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. how did you get that? "
4,6,chandler:," oh, it wasn't a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. "
4,6,rachel:," oh, honey, that's so sweet. "
4,6,phoebe:," yeah, and what a great way to say, ""i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"" "
4,6,chandler:, it doesn't say that. does it? 
4,6,ross:, how do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange? 
4,6,chandler:," okay, all right, i'll just uh, make sure that uh, joey gets her something really great. "
4,6,phoebe:, it's gotta be better than that book. oo! like a crossbow! 
4,6,monica:," yeah, once again, i am sorry. thank you. bye. i just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people. "
4,6,rachel:, oh my god! what happened? 
4,6,monica:, sixty guests. 
4,6,ross:," so, uh, why did you have to turn it down? "
4,6,monica:, because i don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. i mean there's no way. 
4,6,phoebe:," wow, what is with all the negativity? you sound like monican't , not monican... ...monica. look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. do you want to be a caterer or not? "
4,6,monica:, i don't know. 
4,6,phoebe:," there you go, that's the spirit! okay! now, if you need money, i will lend you money, but just get moving! "
4,6,monica:, really? cause i'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff. 
4,6,phoebe:," okay! it's worth it, if it will get you moving. you haven't worked in months. "
4,6,monica:," well, you're not working either. "
4,6,phoebe:," yes, but i'm doing this. "
4,6,monica:," yeah, that'd be great! thank you! "
4,6,joey:, hey!

4,6,chandler:," it's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. hey joe! what are you getting kathy for her birthday? "
4,6,joey:," we've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think i gotta get her something? "
4,6,everyone:, yeah! 
4,6,rachel:," yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice."
4,6,joey:," oh, i know... "
4,6,rachel:," and not one of your coupons for an hour of ""joey love."" "
4,6,phoebe:," ooo, a crossword! can i help? "
4,6,rachel:," no! i'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week i got all but three answers and i really want to finish a whole one without any help. "
4,6,phoebe:, fine. but you can't help me develop my new universal language. 
4,6,monica:, hey! 
4,6,rachel:," hey, how'd it go? "
4,6,monica:," oh my god, it was the best funeral ever! i mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? i even got another funeral for tomorrowthe dead guy from today's best friend. i mean, it is like i am the official caterer for that accident! "
4,6,phoebe:, mon! i'm so happy for you! 
4,6,monica:," thanks. like, check out my new catering stuff. look at this! i'm an omelet station! omelet? made to order! "
4,6,phoebe:," i'll have one, please. plus my money. "
4,6,monica:," oh. well, i didn't realize that you needed it back right away. i mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. so i went. i beed. i mean, i... i used it to buy all this stuff. but looki've got another job tomorrow, so i'll pay you back with the money i make from that. "
4,6,phoebe:," oh. okay. oo, sorry i acted like a bank. "
4,6,monica:, okay. 
4,6,ross:, huh... 
4,6,cheryl:," um, would you like to come in? "
4,6,ross:, did homo erectus hunt with wooden tools? 
4,6,cheryl:, according to recent findings!

4,6,ross:, mitzi is..... 
4,6,cheryl:," my hamster. i hope she's okay, i haven't seen her in a while. have a seat. "
4,6,ross:," uh... oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, cinnamon fruit toasties? "
4,6,cheryl:, what? 
4,6,ross:," well, i do! why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of cinnamon fruit toasties, uh... "
4,6,cheryl:, i'd rather not. 
4,6,ross:," oh, yeah, why not? "
4,6,cheryl:," okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell. "
4,6,monica:," oh, is everything in the car? "
4,6,phoebe:, yes. did you settle the bill? 
4,6,monica:, no. i hate this part. 
4,6,phoebe:," oh, look what we almost left. "
4,6,monica:," no, that's not mine. "
4,6,phoebe:," oh, all right. oh! look what we almost took! "
4,6,monica:," oh, good. thank you. "

4,6,rachel:, you know what we should all do? go see a musical. 
4,6,chandler:, sure... 
4,6,rachel:, and you know which one we should see? the 1996 tony award winner. do you happen to know the name of that one? 
4,6,chandler:," i don't know... um, grease? "
4,6,rachel:, no.... 
4,6,chandler:, rent? 
4,6,rachel:, yes! rent! 
4,6,chandler:," okay, so when do you want to go? "
4,6,rachel:," what? oh, i'm sorry, i can't, i'm busy. "
4,6,joey:," hey. man, it is so hard to shop for girls. "
4,6,chandler:," yes, it is, at office max. "
4,6,rachel:, what did you get her? 
4,6,chandler:, a pen.
4,6,joey:, it's two gifts in one. it's a pen that's also a clock! huh? 
4,6,chandler:, huh huh! you can't give her that. 
4,6,joey:, why not? 
4,6,chandler:, because she's not eleven! and it's not the seventh night of hanukkah! 
4,6,rachel:," okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? "
4,6,joey:," sure it is! she needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""whoa! it's time for my date with joey!"" "
4,6,chandler:," all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday? "
4,6,joey:, she didn't have a birthday while we were going out. 
4,6,chandler:, for three years? 
4,6,joey:," look, it's too late, and i got an audition. i can't shop anymore! i... "
4,6,chandler:," all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay? "
4,6,joey:," thanks, man. and oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? "
4,6,chandler:, would you like me to write her a little poem as well? 
4,6,joey:, or... just get a card that has a poem already in it. 
4,6,phoebe:," but mon, you have to get our money! "
4,6,monica:," oh, phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! with those thick glasses, her tears looked giant. "
4,6,phoebe:," i know, it's tough. you know what the first thing i did after my mother's funeral was? "
4,6,monica:, what? 
4,6,phoebe:," pay the caterer! look, i've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. it's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""i don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. bad little white girl!"" "
4,6,monica:, okay. so what do you.... you think she's faking? 
4,6,phoebe:," well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. "
4,6,monica:," you're a grand ol' flag, you're a high flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave.... "
4,6,phoebe:, ...emblem of the land i love. the home of.... commercial break 
4,6,joey:," so, you just left? her place was really that bad? "
4,6,ross:, you know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? 
4,6,joey:, yeah. 
4,6,ross:," well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. and instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. and instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! here. "
4,6,joey:," wow. thanks. so, uh, what happened? "
4,6,ross:, what do you mean? nothing happened! i had to get out of there. 
4,6,joey:," all right, so... next time, you take her to your place. "
4,6,ross:," no, i tried that. she says it has a weird smell. "
4,6,joey:, what kind of smell? 
4,6,ross:, i don't know. soap? 
4,6,joey:," all right, listen, ross... you like this girl, right? "
4,6,ross:, yeah. 
4,6,joey:," you wanna see her again, right? "
4,6,ross:, yeah. 
4,6,joey:, so you're gonna have to do it in the mess! 
4,6,ross:," yeah, okay you're right. "
4,6,joey:, yeah. 
4,6,ross:," i mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness? "
4,6,joey:, yeah!

4,6,joey:, all right! now you go get that beautiful pig! oink! 
4,6,chandler:," okay, all right. i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit. "
4,6,rachel:, any luck? 
4,6,chandler:," oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called ""invisible things for kathy."" can you give me a hand with all this stuff? "
4,6,rachel:," all right, look. why don't you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. like... a regular pen. "
4,6,chandler:," she's really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if i don't get to be the one who gives it to her. "
4,6,rachel:," aw, honey, that's so sweet. "
4,6,chandler:, yeah? you don't think it's just pathetic? 
4,6,rachel:, oh! pathetic! 
4,6,joey:, hey! i'm meeting kathy in ten minutes! i've been looking all over for you! 
4,6,chandler:, where? 
4,6,joey:," our place, the hall! i... "
4,6,chandler:, i got something for her. it's a book! 
4,6,joey:, a book? is it like a book that's also a safe? 
4,6,chandler:," no, it's a book that's just a book, okay? it's an early edition of the velveteen rabbit. it was her favorite book as a kid. so, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay? "
4,6,joey:," you got it. thanks man. thanks for doing this, i owe you one. oh, hey! there wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? "
4,6,chandler:," no, it came out to an even twenty. "

4,7,ross:," y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise."
4,7,chandler:," it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean it's bad enough that i'm in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, i think she knows. because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. and call me crazy, but i think she likes me too. and now i have seen her naked. i mean at least when i've seen her with clothes on, i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. but there are no boles, she's smooth! smooth! "
4,7,phoebe:, wow! could everyone totally see up his robe?

4,7,chandler:, wait! you're going out with kathy!
4,7,joey:, yeah. why are you getting so upset?
4,7,chandler:," well, i'm upsetfor you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. "
4,7,joey:, what is the big deal? it's not like we're exclusive.
4,7,chandler:," look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that she's she's smart, and funny, and gets you."
4,7,joey:, you got all that from the back of her head?
4,7,chandler:," all right look, i think it's time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane."

4,7,ross:," well umm, y'know, i used to play."

4,8,monica:," umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? come on, one of us had to mention him."
4,8,tim:, i moved back here a couple of months ago.

4,8,monica:, i know. 
4,8,ross:, he's coming here for thanksgiving!
4,8,rachel:," i know, it's sick."

4,8,monica:," hey, come on, phoebe, you understand don't you?"
4,8,phoebe:," yeah, i can see where i'd be your best shot but, no. i'm sorry, but i think it's twisted."

4,8,monica:, me going out with richard's son.
4,8,joey:, ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew!

4,8,rachel:, is he okay in there?
4,8,joey:, he's fine!

4,8,rachel:," so now, what exactly is the point of the box?"
4,8,joey:, chandler?
4,8,chandler:," the meaning of the box is three fold. one , it gives me the time to think about what i did. two , it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey. and three , it hurts!"

4,9,joanna:, congratulations! you now just crossed the line into completely useless. get out. 
4,9,rachel:, do you want me to quit?
4,9,joanna:, what?! what would make you think that?
4,9,rachel:," well of those things that you said in the interview, i mean if you believe any of them, i must not be a very good assistant. y'know what? i am just gonna pack up my desk, and i will be gone by the end of the day! well, i guess there's no use to me sticking around ''til the end of the day! "
4,9,joanna:," wait wait wait wait! you can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. if you must know the truth, i didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant."

4,9,rachel:, my drinking? 
4,9,joanna:," oh, i must've said that after you left."
4,9,rachel:, said what? exactly.
4,9,joanna:, that you enjoyed the occasional drink 'ing binge.

4,9,joanna:," wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait!! if you're gonna get all sensitive about it! i don't want to lose you. what if i, create a position for you? i'll make you an assistant buyer in this department."
4,9,rachel:, say more things like that.
4,9,joanna:," you can have your own office, and a raise! effective tomorrow."
4,9,rachel:, i'd need an expense account.
4,9,joanna:, done!

4,9,monica:, can you believe it? i finally get to run my own kitchen!

4,9,phoebe:, hey!
4,9,rachel:," hey, pheebs, quick question for ya."
4,9,phoebe:, yeah.
4,9,rachel:, how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdale's?

4,9,rachel:, yes!!!
4,9,monica:, you got the job?! why didn't you tell me?

4,9,monica:, i got offered the head chef job at allesandro's.
4,9,phoebe:, what?
4,9,monica:," it's okay, ''cause y'know what? you don't really need me for the business."

4,9,monica:," all right. but umm, i i i'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van."

4,10,ross:," okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and i sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. she was totally at my mercy."
4,10,chandler:, were you so late because you were burring this woman?
4,10,ross:," no, i'm getting back down ''cause she lives in poughkeepsie. she seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away."
4,10,chandler:, how can she be great if she's from poughkeepsie? that joke would've killed in albany.

4,10,rachel:," well, believe me, it's been a long time since i've been flung."
4,10,joey:," well, i know what i'm giving you for christmas."

4,10,monica:," i would love too, but i can't! i mean i just can't, you know that i'm not good at confrontation."
4,10,chandler:," hey, you know what you can do? i remember reading about this director, i think it was orson wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. then they would all know, who's boss."
4,10,joey:," hey, mon! i'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?"
4,10,monica:," that's a good idea! wait, do you know how to waiter?"

4,10,phoebe:," if she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
4,10,ross:," well, i i want to give her another chance, y'know? she lives so close. and, at the end of the date, the other time, she she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny. on the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist."

4,10,joey:," and i gotta pay rent! look, how how about this? you don't fire me, instead i stay here, i gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things i've been saying about you."

4,10,phoebe:," well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in poughkeepsie, so i say you just end them both. okay? you take a train up to poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. and then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!"

4,11,joey:," no, pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy."

4,11,monica:," so big deal, so joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed."
4,11,chandler:," we share a wall! so either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
4,11,monica:," sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. the sex is gonna be great, ''cause you you guys are in love."
4,11,chandler:, yeah?

4,11,phoebe:," i mean, i know what i'm talking about. i gave up two babies, and i only wish i had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. i just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. so, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. i really shouldn't have given you the puppy first."
4,11,phoebe:," all right, i'm sorry. "
4,11,joey:, you mean dr. geller?

4,11,monica:," well, it was the first time. y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time."
4,11,rachel:," yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that."

4,13,ross:, hi!
4,13,kathy:, hi!
4,13,ross:, that is one good looking man!
4,13,chandler:," sooo, you've been doing this long?"
4,13,kathy:," oh, yeah! ooh, that's nice. "
4,13,ross:, is that an expensive blouse?
4,13,kathy:, if you want it to be. 
4,13,ross:, here's your girlfriend's button. opening credits 
4,13,phoebe:," oh, hey, mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?"
4,13,monica:," yeah, i think i have some around here somewhere. why? "
4,13,phoebe:," well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive. "
4,13,monica:," hey, rach! i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. if you could just ' 'throw your purses at it."
4,13,rachel:, bloomingdale's eliminated my department. 
4,13,monica:," oh my god, are you out of a job?"
4,13,rachel:," no, but they stuck me in personal shopping. which is just a huge step down!"
4,13,phoebe:, personal shopping? what is that? like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
4,13,rachel:, uh huh.
4,13,phoebe:, that sounds great!
4,13,joey:, hey! 
4,13,monica:," umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. you can't eat are food anymore, that that gravy train had ended."
4,13,joey:, there's gravy?
4,13,monica:," if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. that fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now. "
4,13,monica:, what are you doing?
4,13,joey:, i think i left a donut up here. 
4,13,ross:, hey!
4,13,phoebe:, hey!
4,13,joey:, hey!
4,13,phoebe:, ooh! how was kathy's play?
4,13,ross:," well, kathy gets half naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy."
4,13,chandler:," yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
4,13,phoebe:, that's a good idea for a business!
4,13,chandler:," i'm totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. y'know it'll be like, ""so where's your boyfriend, what's his name, chester?"" and she'll go, ""no no no, it's chandler."" and he'll go, ""whatever. ha ha ha ha!"""
4,13,joey:, that that is a good trick.
4,13,chandler:," all right, look, look, what am i gonna do?"
4,13,joey:," chandler, look they're actors. they're there to do a job, just ''cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. i mean just ''cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them."
4,13,ross:," oh oh, alec baldwin and kim basinger."
4,13,joey:, tom cruise and nicole kidman. 
4,13,ross:, yeah.
4,13,phoebe:," hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood."
4,13,ross:, they're not a couple!
4,13,phoebe:," oh okay, i get the game now."
4,13,joey:," okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
4,13,ross:, oh yeah!
4,13,joey:," well okay, so then you're fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. it's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble."
4,13,chandler:, really?
4,13,joey:," look, you guys have been to every play i've ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?"
4,13,ross:, no.
4,13,joey:, noooo!! 
4,13,chandler:," so uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
4,13,ross:," y'know what, i don't know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
4,13,chandler:," yeah, i know but '"
4,13,ross:," oh no no no, i'm there."
4,13,monica:, hey!
4,13,joey:, hey mon! want some pancakes?
4,13,monica:, you made pancakes?
4,13,joey:, yep! grab a plate.
4,13,monica:, okay. 
4,13,joey:," no no, stay right there. gettin' closer."
4,13,chandler:," okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. which i'm fairly certain are the same thing."
4,13,joey:," listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here saturday night, if people want to come over."
4,13,ross:, oh yeah!
4,13,monica:," oh, i was thinking about having people over for the game."
4,13,joey:," oh yeah, who's playing?"
4,13,monica:, the players.
4,13,ross:, somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
4,13,monica:," please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is."
4,13,joey:," all right pheebs, stick out your plate!"
4,13,phoebe:, oh. 
4,13,rachel:," in a moment, please, i'm in the middle of a task. and you have a customer. "
4,13,rachel:, hi!
4,13,joshua:," hi, i'm joshua."
4,13,rachel:," hi, i'm rachel green. what can i do for you joshua?"
4,13,joshua:," well, i need a whole new wardrobe. my wife, well my ex wife '"
4,13,rachel:," oh, i'm so sorry. "
4,13,joshua:," anyway, she burned all of my clothes. i got away with two things. this suit and what turned out to be a skirt."
4,13,rachel:," well, at least that's a great suit."
4,13,joshua:," yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. so i need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, i'm all yours."
4,13,rachel:," rachel, you needed to speak to me?"
4,13,rachel:," no no, that wasn't me! well, we should get started. let me show you my underwear. the selection of underwear we carry. "
4,13,rachel:," oh oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way. "
4,13,joshua:, it's this way? sorry. 
4,13,chandler:," i'm right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. before they had heat, and now there's no heat! now you know what this means, joey told us what this means!"
4,13,ross:," all right, let's not jump to any conclusions. all right? there was some sexual chemistry between them."
4,13,chandler:," come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
4,13,ross:," here she comes. don't say a word, okay? just be cool, don't be 'y'know you."
4,13,kathy:, hey you guys!
4,13,ross:, hey!
4,13,kathy:, hi! thank you so much for coming again. did you like it tonight?
4,13,ross:," oh, absolutely! "
4,13,kathy:, wasn't nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit? 
4,13,kathy:," it's a good play, isn't it? "
4,13,chandler:," oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly you're having sex with him."
4,13,ross:," okay, i ' "
4,13,kathy:," clearly, i'm having sex with him?"
4,13,chandler:," oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two!"
4,13,kathy:," okay, so let me just get this straight. you're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?"
4,13,chandler:," y'know, i i could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing."
4,13,kathy:," acting! chandler, this is my job! i'm i'm playing a part in a play! how can you not trust me?!"
4,13,chandler:," well, you can understand, given how we started."
4,13,kathy:," oh, wow. i can't believe you're throwing that in my face."
4,13,chandler:," well, that is what happened, and i don't even see you denying this!"
4,13,kathy:," i'll tell you what, chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!"
4,13,chandler:," yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon! commercial break "
4,13,rachel:," i have the best job in the entire world! the most adorable guy came over today, and i got to dress him up all day!"
4,13,phoebe:, rachel has a new doll.

4,13,phoebe:," well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?"
4,13,monica:," ''cause they took our apartment, i wanted to punish them. but i'm i'm done now. they've suffered enough."

4,13,rachel:," yeah, that's true."
4,13,monica:," all right then, when i'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!"
4,13,phoebe:," oh, are we gonna trash that place? "
4,13,chandler:, steps! slut! you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy!
4,13,all:, what?!

4,13,joey:," oh, yeah, totally! that's such a turn on!"
4,13,rachel:, really? it doesn't seem desperate?
4,13,joey:," oh ooh, that's the turn on."
4,13,phoebe:, he just got a divorce right? 
4,13,rachel:, hmm mmm.
4,13,phoebe:," so he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? maybe, you just have to make the first move."
4,13,rachel:," yeah but, i've never asked a guy out before."
4,13,phoebe:, you've never asked a guy out?!!
4,13,rachel:, no. have you?
4,13,phoebe:, thousands of times!! that doesn't make me sound too good does it?
4,13,rachel:, i don't even know how i would go about it.

4,13,chandler:," she did not have to tell me, i saw the play, and there was no heat. back me up here, ross!"
4,13,ross:, that's all you're basing this on?
4,13,chandler:," that's not backing me up! look, you said with the off stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
4,13,joey:," whoa whoa, that that was just a theory! there's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. the lone gunman. communism. geometry."

4,13,phoebe:, how? how is your fault?
4,13,chandler:," because, i i should've called! y'know if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. i threw her at his man nipples!"
4,13,rachel:," honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone."

4,14,monica:, so you hit her in the face?
4,14,rachel:," no, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so i clocked her. ohhh! i can't believe this, all i wanted was a few hours outside of work to see joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
4,14,phoebe:," aww, pheebs."
4,14,rachel:," honey, that's you're name."

4,23,phoebe:," yeah, i do. what's the matter?"
4,23,rachel:, i'm just bummed about the way i left things with ross. i shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. he seemed so mad at me.
4,23,phoebe:," eh, don't be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was getting married '"
4,23,rachel:, still in love with?! 
4,23,phoebe:, yeah!
4,23,rachel:, i'm not in love with ross!
4,23,phoebe:," oh. no. no. good! yeah, me neither."
4,23,rachel:," phoebe, i'm going to ross's wedding because he is my ex boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. not because, i'm still in love with him! i mean, hey, y'know, i like ross as much as the next guy, y'know? clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! i mean, i still have loving feelings for ross. yeah! but, i have, i have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that that i'm still in love with him. y'know? i i have sexual feelings for him, but i do love himohh! oh my god! oh mywhy didn't you tell me?!!"
4,23,phoebe:, we thought you knew!
4,23,rachel:, we?!
4,23,phoebe:," yeah, we all know! we talk about it all the time!"
4,23,rachel:, you all know? does ross know?
4,23,phoebe:," oh no, ross doesn't know anything."
4,23,rachel:," oh, i can not believe you didn't tell me!"
4,23,phoebe:," well, because we thought you knew!! it's so obvious! god, that would be like telling monica, ""hey, you like things clean."" "
4,23,joey:," so, what are you guys in the market for? we've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards..."
4,23,joey:, check this out? huh? yeah. that's the stuff. what do you think?
4,23,chandler:," well, i don't have to buy that, ""i'm with stupid"" t shirt anymore."
4,23,joey:," well, i like it. here you go. "
4,23,chandler:," all right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?"
4,23,joey:," oh, i embarrass you? "
4,23,chandler:, he's just jealous. you'll fit right in; all londoners wear them!
4,23,chandler:, they're all tourists.
4,23,chandler:," all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
4,23,joey:, good choice.
4,23,joey:, thanks.
4,23,chandler:," okay, wait. all right, that's it, okay, i'm out of here. i am not going to be embarrassed anymore! "
4,23,emily:, hello?
4,23,ross:," hey! i just spoke to your dad, and you know what? he seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding."
4,23,emily:, we don't have to.
4,23,ross:, whoa whoa what? you found a place?
4,23,emily:," no. but, monica and i were talking, and and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit."
4,23,ross:, she said what?
4,23,emily:," she said, ""if i'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""
4,23,ross:," postpone it? emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? do you my sister's teeny tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? this isn't right."
4,23,emily:," i realize that people are going to be disappointed. but, i'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right."
4,23,ross:, i can't ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that? 
4,23,emily:," don't you point your pants at me! we have no choice! anywhere that's half decent would've be booked months ago, ross don't you understand? this is our wedding i'm talking about."
4,23,ross:, the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when we're getting married.
4,23,emily:, so what are you saying? it's now or never?
4,23,ross:, no. i'm saying it's now. 
4,23,emily:, or?
4,23,ross:, there's no ''or' in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!!
4,23,emily:," it's not the pants. it's you that is backwards. and if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all! "
4,23,ross:," no, wait! emily! no, wait, stop! emily, please commercial break "
4,23,phoebe:, hey!
4,23,rachel:, hi.
4,23,phoebe:," so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross?"
4,23,rachel:, manhattan does not have enough stores.
4,23,phoebe:," well, i think i can help you get over him."
4,23,rachel:, you can?
4,23,phoebe:, yeah. i just need you to bring me some photos of ross.
4,23,rachel:, um hmm.
4,23,phoebe:, and a small piece of chocolate.
4,23,rachel:, okay.
4,23,phoebe:, and a glass of tepid water. 
4,23,rachel:," ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north facing tree?"
4,23,phoebe:," uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just didn't feel like getting up. okay, i'm gonna show you a picture of ross. okay? and you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws."
4,23,rachel:, i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out.
4,23,phoebe:," okay. umm, before we get started, i just wanna say for the record that i love ross, i think he's such a great guy. here. okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that you're with ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. and you're you're running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew oh gross it's some kind of grease, it'suck! hah?"
4,23,rachel:," i don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
4,23,phoebe:," okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy."
4,23,rachel:, okay.
4,23,phoebe:, okay?
4,23,rachel:, all right.
4,23,phoebe:," so uh, now look at the picture '"
4,23,rachel:, okay.
4,23,phoebe:," all right, and umm ' "
4,23,rachel:, ow!
4,23,phoebe:," okay, how do you feel now?"
4,23,rachel:," well, i like you less! "
4,23,joey:, hey.
4,23,chandler:, hey. 
4,23,joey:, oh. sorry!
4,23,chandler:," no no no, y'know what? i really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really wasn't cool. and if it makes you feel any better, i've had a really lousy day."
4,23,joey:, me too.
4,23,chandler:, yeah?
4,23,joey:," noo!! i've had the best day ever! dude, check this out!"
4,23,monica:, hey!

4,23,monica:, oh my god!
4,23,joey:, that's fergie baby!!
4,23,fergie:," joey says you don't really like his hat, but i think it's kinda dashing."
4,23,chandler:, how did you? how? how?
4,23,joey:," well, i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace, right? so, i'm in my map and and ' hey!"

4,23,monica:, umm '
4,23,chandler:, i'm gonna go to the bathroom.
4,23,joey:, wait up! 
4,23,ross:," hey hey, since you're the ''fix it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?"
4,23,monica:, she said that?!
4,23,ross:, yeah.
4,23,monica:, why?!
4,23,ross:," i don't know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
4,23,monica:, oh my god. you're even dumber than i am!
4,23,ross:, excuse me?
4,23,monica:," ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
4,23,ross:, i don't know. a month?
4,23,monica:," emily has probably been planning it since she was five! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. that's what we did! we dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. thanks. but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was."
4,23,ross:," i had no idea. and that that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun."
4,23,monica:, sometimes we were.
4,23,ross:, come on. you gotta help me figure out what to do. okay?
4,23,monica:, okay.
4,23,ross:, come on. 
4,23,chandler:, that was pretty intense huh?
4,23,joey:," yeah. hey, i hope ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
4,23,chandler:, i hope he did! 
4,23,phoebe:, hello.
4,23,joey:," hey, pheebs! it's joey!"
4,23,phoebe:," hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on thethat looks just like you on the subway. and i was gonna go over and say ''hi!' but then i figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you."
4,23,joey:," that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
4,23,phoebe:," ohh, they're having a great time with their aunt phoebe! aunt rachel hasn't been helpful at all. so, do you miss me?"
4,23,joey:," kinda, but i've just been having way too much fun."
4,23,phoebe:, so you're not homesick yet?
4,23,joey:," no, i don't think so."

4,23,monica:," and the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? and the chairs can face this way , and ' you go."
4,23,ross:," but but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. really, it's fine, whatever you want."
4,23,emily:, it's perfect.
4,23,ross:," and, i don't know, if it starts to rain '"
4,23,emily:, well then we'll get wet.

4,23,rachel:," yeah, i know, i know, i know he does. but i have to tell him how i feel! he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
4,23,phoebe:," that's not why you're going! you're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""yeah, i love you too, rach. forget that british chippy."""
4,23,rachel:, ohhdo you think he will?!
4,23,phoebe:," no! because he's in love with the british chippy! look, rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! y'know, it's too late! you missed you're chance! i'm sorry, i know this must be really hard, it's over."

5,4,phoebe:," ugh, pbs!"
5,4,monica:, what's wrong with pbs?
5,4,phoebe:," ugh, what's right with them?"
5,4,joey:," why don't you like pbs, pheebs?"
5,4,phoebe:," okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, i was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. so, i just thought that it'd make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street, 'cause they were so nice when i was a little kid! no one ever wrote back."
5,4,chandler:, well y'know a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.
5,4,phoebe:, all i got was a lousy key chain! and by that time i was living in a box. i didn't have keys!
5,4,joey:," i'm sorry pheebs, i just, y'know, i just wanted to do a good deed. like like you did with the babies."
5,4,phoebe:," this isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on tv! this is totally selfish."
5,4,joey:," whoa! whoa! whoa! what about you, having those babies for your brother? talk about selfish!"
5,4,phoebe:, what what are you talking about?!
5,4,joey:," well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?"
5,4,phoebe:, yeah. so?
5,4,joey:," it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry."
5,4,phoebe:, yes there are! there are totally good deeds that are selfless.
5,4,joey:," well, may i ask for one example?"
5,4,phoebe:," yeah, it's ' y'know there'sno you may not! "
5,4,joey:, that's because all people are selfish.
5,4,phoebe:, are you calling me selfish?!
5,4,joey:," are you calling you people? yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. okay? and you the deal on santa clause right?"
5,4,phoebe:," i'm gonna find a selfless good dead. i'm gonna beat you, you evil genius. "
5,4,ross:, hello.
5,4,emily:," hello, ross?"
5,4,ross:," emily? emily! oh my god! oh my god, it's emily! it's emily everyone! shush shush shhst! hi!"
5,4,emily:," ross, i'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. good bye!"
5,4,ross:," no wait! look, wait! okay, you can hang up, but i'm gonna keep calling! i'm gonna, i'm gonna call everyone in england if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!"

5,4,emily:," i miss you to. well, at least i think i do."
5,4,ross:, she's talking.
5,4,all:, yay! 
5,4,phoebe:," hey, joey, when you said the deal with santa clause, you meant?"
5,4,joey:, that he doesn't exist.
5,4,phoebe:, right. 
5,4,rachel:," so chandler, have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend?"
5,4,chandler:," uhh, yeah. she uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
5,4,rachel:," so mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?"
5,4,monica:," ohh, he's really shy. i i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
5,4,chandler:," yeah, i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
5,4,rachel:, i don't care! i wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had! 
5,4,chandler:, really?! that's what you heard? you said that?
5,4,monica:, i might've said that. why is that funny?
5,4,chandler:," because i'm very happy for him! and you, you lucky dog!"
5,4,ross:, hi!
5,4,monica:, hey!
5,4,ross:," well, emily's willing to work on the relationship."
5,4,chandler:, yes!
5,4,monica:, that's great!
5,4,ross:, in london!
5,4,monica:, what?!
5,4,ross:, she wants me to move to london.
5,4,monica:, but you live here! you know that.
5,4,rachel:, what what what are you gonna do?
5,4,ross:, i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben.
5,4,monica:," yeah, i'm sure your ex wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife."
5,4,ross:, it could happen. 
5,4,joey:, this will be your phone.
5,4,joey:, no you answer it and take pledges.
5,4,joey:," no, gary collins is the host. you'll be answering the phones."
5,4,joey:," well, here's your phone doctor. "
5,4,phoebe:," i cannot believe i can't find a selfless good deed! y'know that old guy that lives next to me? well, i snuck over there and and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. but he caught me and force fed me cider and cookies. then i felt wonderful. that old jackass!"
5,4,rachel:, maybe joey's right. maybe all good deeds are selfish.
5,4,phoebe:, i will find a selfless good deed! 'cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right!
5,4,chandler:," hey, monica? can i ask you a cooking question?"
5,4,monica:, sure!
5,4,chandler:," if you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard?"
5,4,rachel:, chandler! is he?
5,4,monica:," well, y'know i i i think i'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend."
5,4,chandler:," why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, i'd be going like this. "
5,4,ross:," all right emily, as much as i love you, i'm sorry, i can't move to london without ben."
5,4,emily:, i understand that would be difficult.
5,4,ross:," yeah, would you please consider moving here? i mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?"
5,4,emily:," i don't know, it's just '"
5,4,ross:," oh oh okay, but but i know, that even though i've been a a complete idiot up 'til now, i mean, i mean you you you have to come here. you have to come here so we can work this out."
5,4,emily:, all right.
5,4,ross:," all right, did you just say all right?"
5,4,emily:, i did. now i'm the idiot.
5,4,ross:," oh, emily that is, that is so great. it's gonna be so great! we're gonna be like like like two idiots in love! "
5,4,emily:," ross, there's one thing that really scares me still."
5,4,ross:," yes, tell me."
5,4,emily:," well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends."
5,4,ross:," i know. i am, i am so sorry."
5,4,emily:," and then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her."
5,4,ross:," again, very sorry."
5,4,emily:," i mean, i can't i can't be in the same room as her! it drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!"
5,4,ross:," emily, there is nothing between rachel and me. okay? i love you."
5,4,emily:, all right. i'll come to new york and we'll try and make this work.
5,4,ross:, oh that is so great! that's '
5,4,emily:, as long as you don't see rachel anymore. commercial break 
5,4,ross:," so i asked emily if she would come to new york, and she said yes."
5,4,chandler:, yes!
5,4,phoebe:, ooh ohh!
5,4,monica:, great!
5,4,ross:, no no no! only if i promise never to see rachel again.
5,4,phoebe:, why?
5,4,monica:, what?! you can'twhat did you tell her?
5,4,ross:," i told her i'd have to think about it. i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision? i'm actually asking you!"
5,4,chandler:," well, you can't just not see rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends."
5,4,monica:," yeah! but, he can't not exactly see emily, i mean that's his wife."
5,4,phoebe:, yeah.
5,4,chandler:, that's true!
5,4,phoebe:," yeah, but you've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life."
5,4,chandler:, that's true!
5,4,monica:," no, you cannot."

5,4,chandler:," oh that was yours? uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars. "
5,4,monica:," william sonoma, fall catalog, page 27."
5,4,chandler:," expect it in 4 6 weeks. umm, hey, umm, joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
5,4,monica:," yeah, so?"

5,4,ross:," okay, that's it. i cannot make this decision! it is too difficult, so i'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. "
5,4,monica:," a magic eight ball?! you can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!"
5,4,phoebe:," ooh, it's not a toy."
5,4,ross:," well, i don't know what else to do. i mean, i either keep my wife and lose one of my my my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before i'm 30! so so if anyone has has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'cause i i got nothing! all right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. okay then. here we go. magic 8 ball, should i never see rachel again? ask again later. later is not good enough. ask again later. what the hell! this is broken! it it is broken!"

5,4,phoebe:," oh, i'm still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, i'm doing a good thing, but i'm not happy about it. so there, a selfless good deed."
5,4,joey:, and you don't a little good about donating the money?
5,4,phoebe:," no, it sucks. i was saving up to buy a hamster."
5,4,joey:," a hamster? what, those things are like 10 bucks."
5,4,phoebe:," it looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! thank you viewers! the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers ' oh boy! and may i say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, mr. joseph tribbiani!"
5,4,phoebe:," oh, look look, joey's on tv! isn't that great? my pledge got joey on tv! oh that makes me feeloh no! "
5,4,chandler:," look, maybe i got carried away before. but there's something you gotta know. if i'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best."
5,4,monica:, keep talking.
5,4,chandler:," i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which wouldn't take long. but when i'm with you, and we're together, oh 'my 'god."

5,4,rachel:," well, i i know you can do that too. i'm just, i'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to ' hi!"
5,4,ross:, thanks.
5,4,rachel:," ross? look, whatever this relationship stuff that emily wants, just give it to her. come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. so just fix whatever she wants fixed. just do it. i mean, you're gonna have to try. you'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. oh come on answer it! it's driving me crazy!"

5,6,joey:," hey, ross, you're okay with that?"
5,6,ross:," look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, i'm sure everything will be fine."
5,6,chandler:," okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?"
5,6,ross:, after what i did? can you blame her?
5,6,phoebe:," oh my god! you got off easy! when my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green. "
5,6,joey:," what is he doing? what, emily, thinks ross's furniture has got rachel coodies?"
5,6,monica:, now calm down joey.
5,6,joey:," no! everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? emily won't let ross see rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing rachel, hence ross stops seeing us!"
5,6,phoebe:," oh, i hate this. everything's changing."
5,6,chandler:," yeah i know, we're losing ross, joey said hence '"
5,6,monica:," look, i'm not happy about this either, but y'know if if ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves. are you cool with that?"
5,6,joey:," no! but y'know, i'm an actor, i'll act cool. "
5,6,rachel:," ohh, whoa god! storage rooms give me the creeps! monica, come on please hurry up honey! please? "

5,6,rachel:," what? uhh, phoebe, honey, honey, i know you're quirky and i get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! not nature, fashion!"

5,6,ross:," i loved this place! to tell you the truth, i wish i didn't have to move."
5,6,joey:," uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
5,6,ross:," well, i mean if uh, if emily gave me a choice '"
5,6,joey:," you do have a choice!! ross, why are you listening to her?! are you, are you crazy?!"
5,6,ross:, why?
5,6,joey:," it's not right what emily wants you to do! she is totally owww!! stop pinching me! look, now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right? well he just told me that he's not entirely happy."
5,6,ross:, what's going on?
5,6,joey:, we all hate emily!
5,6,phoebe:, nooo!!

5,6,chandler:," look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
5,6,joey:, yes! yes! unreasonable!
5,6,ross:," unreasonable? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! all right, it's about compromise! do you always like it? no! do you do it? yes! because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time! it's real life, okay? it's what grown ups do!

5,6,joey:," well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! "
5,6,chandler:," well, i think it's very brave what you said. "
5,6,phoebe:," all right, i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places. "
5,6,chandler:," pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing?"

5,7,monica:, great. so the ball is in his court?
5,7,rachel:, ball? there is no ball. 
5,7,ross:," joey, please! "
5,7,joey:, sorry.

5,9,monica:, a pill?
5,9,ross:," uh huh. well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. and i thought was a good idea so, i took it."

5,9,chandler:, and you're okay with that?
5,9,ross:," i don't know. it's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but i, i definitely don't care about my sandwich. "
5,9,rachel:," ugh, that was so embarrassing! i can't believe you let me go on and on like that!"
5,9,phoebe:, i'm sorry. it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop.

5,9,rachel:," phoebe, come on! what is the big deal? i thought this was going to be something we could do together! y'know, i thought it would be fun!"

5,9,ross:, this is not good for my rage. 
5,9,rachel:," monica, is this true?"
5,9,joey:, of course it's true! how else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
5,9,monica:, yes it's true.
5,9,rachel:," okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?"
5,9,joey:, ahhoy! that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london. right monica?
5,9,monica:, i guess i wanted to keep it as a souvenir. 
5,9,ross:, my god monica!!
5,9,chandler:, are you sure joe? are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
5,9,joey:," no! if anyone's a sex addict here, it's monica! yeah. yeah. she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london!"

5,9,joey:, that makes sense!
5,9,rachel:, and the video camera?
5,9,joey:," uhh, monica?"

5,9,joey:, but sadly i could not be enticed.
5,9,ross:, unbelievable! i mean you really kept joey's underwear?! why? why would you do that?!
5,9,monica:, i'm monica. i'm disgusting. i stalk guys and keep their underpants.

5,10,ross:, i am not unemployed. i'm on sabbatical!
5,10,joey:," come on look guys, don't fight."
5,10,ross:," and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend. and if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing."
5,10,chandler:," oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
5,10,ross:, if it does? then you're an amazing friend of mine.
5,10,joey:," hey hey guys, hey! how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball? huh? i'll go unhook the smoke detectors!"

5,13,joey:," oh! yeah, look there's this play all right? and i'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. a real clothes horse. so i figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra hip, high fashion stuff."
5,13,chandler:, and you're gonna make them all disappear.
5,13,joey:," yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this. "
5,13,chandler:, done.
5,13,rachel:," joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? i'll help you out."

5,13,rachel:," okay now joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?"

5,15,rachel:," umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head."
5,15,chandler:, wh wh why?!
5,15,rachel:," well, because she loves you and because you love her."
5,15,chandler:," yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"

5,15,chandler:," i don't see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who's to say what she wants?! i'm right. i'm right. am i right?"
5,15,rachel:," no, you're right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different."
5,15,chandler:," okay. it's not different at all, is it?"

5,15,katie:, you were so funny with that waiter! you're such a nut! 
5,15,joey:," y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny."

5,15,joey:," uhh, look katie, uh listen, we we need to talk. okay? umm, look i like you. i i really do, i like you a lot. okay? but sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat."
5,15,katie:," aww, like i could hurt you. are you making fun of my size? don't make fun of me because of my size! "
5,15,monica:, isn't this great?

5,15,ross:, what?!
5,15,phoebe:," yeah, i think i told it wrong. y'know, we should talk about that because i don't totally understand what happened there."
5,15,ross:," ohh, this cake is really good!"

"
5,15,phoebe:," obviously i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero."
5,15,ross:," oh wow, yeah! see, i did not get that. "
5,15,chandler:, where's monica?! where is she? i need to talk to her! it's urgent! is she here?
5,15,monica:, i'm monica.
5,15,chandler:," i need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
5,15,monica:, okay.
5,15,chandler:," okay, i've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. and uh, well i guess there's only one one way to do this. "

5,15,chandler:, i don't know. but i know i'm not afraid to do this.
5,15,monica:, chandler.
5,15,chandler:, i'm doing this because i'm sorry?
5,15,monica:," do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?"
5,15,chandler:," no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. will you be my wife?"
5,15,monica:," chandler, umm, i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds."
5,15,chandler:," yeah, i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
5,15,monica:, honey! do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now!
5,15,chandler:," yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys. "
5,15,monica:, who? two divorces and joey?!
5,15,ross:, hey!
5,15,joey:, she's right y'know.
5,15,ross:," yeah, but still, cheap shot!"
5,15,monica:," y'know what? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? well, you're not ready for that."
5,15,chandler:, i didn't think i was! 
5,15,monica:," oh my god, what would have done if i said yes?"
5,15,chandler:," well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door. ending credits "
5,15,joey:," hey ross, will you pass me that knife?"
5,15,ross:," no, i will not!"
5,15,joey:," oh, it's okay. you don't have to be so mean about it."
5,15,ross:," you're right, i'm sorry. will you marry me? "
5,15,phoebe:," aw, and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week."
5,15,rachel:," oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure, chandler?"
5,15,chandler:," okay, how long is this going to go on."
5,15,monica:," well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time."
5,15,ross:," this is fun. hey rach, remember that whole ""we were on a break thing?"" well, i'm sorry, will you marry me? "
5,15,chandler:, that's not funny.
5,15,joey:, that's not funny at all! 
5,16,joey:, hey!

5,16,monica:, wow!
5,16,chandler:," oh that's so cool! why would a cop come in here though? they don't serve donuts. y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? i think i can come up with something better than that."
5,16,rachel:," phoebe, i bet somebody's missing that badge."
5,16,phoebe:," yeah, i should probably take it back. ooh, but you know what? while i'm at the police station, i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! "

5,16,monica:," phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!"
5,16,phoebe:, i know but i'm having so much fun doing good deeds.

5,16,joey:," don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. i haven't dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two ish. "
5,16,monica:, what was the dream about?
5,16,joey:," well, okay. you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. y'know like you guys were doing last night. so, that's it. i'm in love with monica and i'll be moving out."
5,16,monica:," wait, joey! joey! that doesn't mean that that you're in love with me!"
5,16,joey:, it it doesn't?
5,16,monica:, no!
5,16,chandler:," no, it can mean anything. like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because i've become the apartment stud."
5,16,joey:, that kinda sounds like your dream dude.
5,16,monica:," or, it could mean that that you saw chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too."
5,16,joey:, in the dream i did enjoy the closeness.
5,16,monica:, um hmm.
5,16,chandler:," joey, look, are you attracted to monica? right here, right now, are you attracted to her?"
5,16,joey:, not really.
5,16,chandler:, well there you have it!
5,16,monica:," well sure! i'm just wearing sweats! but that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!"
5,16,joey:," no, i don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. y'know? i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend! yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like like you guys have?"
5,16,chandler:," well y'know, monica and i were friends before we started dating. so maybe maybe that's it?"
5,16,joey:, friends first? that's interesting.
5,16,monica:, you become friends after?
5,16,joey:," no, never done that either."
5,16,rachel:," hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"
5,16,chandler:," oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom. "
5,16,monica:, that's right. 
5,16,rachel:, what's up joey?

5,16,guy:, yeah.
5,16,phoebe:," well i don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance. "
5,16,guy:, don't worry about it. it's not a problem.
5,16,phoebe:," well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause i'm a cop. "
5,16,guy:, so am i!
5,16,phoebe:," ohh, no. oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause i know that 'cause i'm a cop too. so, all right, keep up the good work. 10 4. "
5,16,cop:," hey, wait a second! so wait, what precinct are you with?"

5,16,cop:, who who else is in vice up there?
5,16,phoebe:," umm, do you know, umm sipowicz?"
5,16,cop:," sipowicz? no, i don't think so."
5,16,phoebe:," yeah, big guy, kinda bald."
5,16,cop:," no, i don't know him."
5,16,phoebe:," don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. his umm, his partner just died."
5,16,cop:," wow umm, tell sipowicz i'm real sorry for his loss."
5,16,phoebe:," i i sure will, take care. "
5,16,cop:," hey by the way, i'm sure sipowicz is gonna be all right. i heard that kid from silver spoons is really good. and where did you find my badge?"
5,16,phoebe:, oh. 
5,16,rachel:," hey! joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch?"
5,16,joey:," oh, i'd love too, but i got acting class. but y'know what? i guess i can blow that off, for you. "
5,16,rachel:, thanks!
5,16,joey:," uh, hey, rach let me ask you something. uh, i was just over there talking to monica and chandler, boy they are really tight."
5,16,rachel:, i know.
5,16,joey:, yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. i'm thinking of getting me one of those.
5,16,rachel:, what's up joe?
5,16,joey:," well, the reason i think monica and chandler are so great '"
5,16,rachel:, yeah?
5,16,joey:," 'is because they were friends first. y'know? so i asked myself, ""who are my friends?"" you and phoebe, and i saw you first. so '"
5,16,rachel:, what are you saying?
5,16,joey:, i'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch.
5,16,rachel:," y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as i am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, i just, i i don't think we should be cranking anything up."
5,16,joey:, i'll treat you real nice. 
5,16,rachel:," yeah, well, y'know umm ' no honey, listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. don't hit on your existing friends!"
5,16,joey:, won't won't that take longer?
5,16,rachel:," yeah. yeah. oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait."
5,16,joey:," yeah. i understand. i understand. man, i wish i saw phoebe first! "
5,16,ross:," come here to me. no no, you come here to me."
5,16,rachel:, hey ross! i brought reinforcements.
5,16,ross:," oh great! what, you brought joey?"
5,16,rachel:," well, i brought the next best thing."
5,16,chandler:, hey!
5,16,ross:, chandler?! you brought chandler?! the next best thing would be monica!
5,16,chandler:," y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so '"
5,16,ross:," look, i i drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. okay rach, that's you. that's the couch. "
5,16,rachel:," whoa oh, what's what's that? "
5,16,ross:," oh, that's me."
5,16,rachel:, wow! you certainly think a lot of yourself.
5,16,ross:, no! that's that's my arm!
5,16,chandler:," oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch."

5,16,joey:," well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
5,16,rachel:, what?! why?!
5,16,joey:," well because you didn't give me advice! no! you gave me a pickup line! as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. i suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! and her roommate!"
5,16,monica:, what about the closeness?

5,16,rachel:," oh my god, phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!"
5,16,phoebe:," well, if i'm going down, i'm taking you with me. harboring a fugitive? that's one to three years minimum. good luck chandler. okay, you can arrest me. fine. but you'll never make it stick and you know it!"
5,16,cop:," yeah, but i kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. i mean, you understand right?"
5,16,phoebe:, yep! as long as you understand that i'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. a fool!
5,16,cop:," i don't like looking foolish. y'know what? maybe uh, i don't arrest you today. maybe i came by and you weren't here."
5,16,phoebe:, i would love it if i weren't here!
5,16,cop:," okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight i was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?"

5,17,monica:," come on, we can't let them win!"
5,17,chandler:," ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! okay? so why why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!"
5,17,monica:, because phoebe and gary are in that can't keep their hands off each other doing it in the park phase!

5,18,ross:," all right, i gotta take off. i'm picking up ben then we're off to the big audition."
5,18,monica:, it's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad.

5,18,joey:, whoa whoa dad? there's a dad in the commercial?

5,18,rachel:, 'and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
5,18,monica:, that doesn't seem fair.
5,18,rachel:," i know! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!"
5,18,chandler:," yeah, it is the best."
5,18,rachel:," i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they'll they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? me or smokey smokerson?"
5,18,monica:," rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. just say you wanna get some fresh air."

5,20,rachel:, noo! oh no! no! god no! he should not get back together with her. i know that! you know that! even ross knows that! but that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
5,20,monica:," i'm his sister, okay? i love him! i don't want to see him get hurt! come on! doesn't that give me the right to control himhelp him?"
5,20,rachel:, i don't think he's the one who needs help. 
5,20,monica:," no, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? i mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. okay, fine! but i mean, look at the position she's putting him in! what's he gonna do? ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! i mean, who would do that?! okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! although it did involve a lot of the same people."
5,20,rachel:, ugh!
5,20,monica:," y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him."
5,20,rachel:, your messages have been erased.

5,20,chandler:," oh, hurry up. i want to sign that."
5,20,gary:," okay, here he comes. what is he doing? what the hell is he doing?!"

5,20,monica:," well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, i can't argue with you! all right? fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. i just don't want to be a part of it. "
5,20,rachel:," oh, maybe that's emily calling back to leave the exact same message."
5,20,ross:," hey ross! it's you! i just want you to remember this feeling. you are lucky to be alive! so live everyday to the fullest. love yourself, okay? okay. oh, and also get stamps. bye! "
5,20,monica:, wow! play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away!
5,20,rachel:, right?

5,20,ross:," yeah, but but he didn't know that!"
5,20,joey:," yeah, i didn't know that."
5,20,ross:, and it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
5,20,gary:," hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you."
5,20,chandler:, who jumps at loud noises!
5,20,ross:, wow! i could've died tonight.
5,20,chandler:," yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. "
5,20,ross:, i do have a newfound respect for life.
5,20,chandler:, oh my god! 
5,20,gary:, so you wanna get some dinner?
5,20,phoebe:," yeah! sure! yep! oh, y'know what? if i heard a shot right now, i'd throw my body on you."
5,20,gary:, oh yeah? well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
5,20,phoebe:, okay!
5,20,gary:, all right.
5,20,phoebe:, bye!

5,20,joey:, of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up! you want ross out of the picture.
5,20,chandler:, what picture?
5,20,joey:," i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing!"
5,20,chandler:," look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!"
5,20,joey:," ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! i 'knew 'you could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help. he's not street like us!"
5,20,chandler:," when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that's the bottom line."
5,20,joey:," well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross. all right? i was, i was trying to save my sandwich."
5,20,chandler:, from a bullet!

5,20,chandler:, much sense?!
5,20,joey:," look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it!"
5,20,chandler:," so you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
5,20,joey:," i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!"
5,20,chandler:," so you didn't uh, choose ross before me."
5,20,joey:, no! i would never do that! you you're like my brother!
5,20,chandler:, really?!
5,20,joey:," yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here."
5,20,chandler:, thanks. 
5,20,joey:," no, eh, oh oi, easy, it's not a hot dog! "
5,20,joey:, how good is that?
5,20,chandler:," oh oi ho, yeah!"
5,20,joey:, see?
5,20,chandler:, hm hmm. 
5,20,joey:," oh whoa hey, dude, what are you doing?!"
5,20,chandler:, i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
5,20,joey:, yeah. with a bite! gee e e eez! 
5,20,rachel:, hey! hi!
5,20,ross:," rach, what uh, what are you doing here?"
5,20,rachel:," hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!"
5,20,ross:," y'know, it it doesn't matter. the important thing is that you're here. you're my friend, and you're here. oh! "
5,20,rachel:," okay, just a little scared. what's going on ross?"
5,20,ross:, the most amazing thing happened tonight. i thought my number was up. i had an actual near death experience!
5,20,rachel:, what?! what? what happened?!
5,20,ross:," okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right? "
5,20,rachel:, yeah!
5,20,ross:, and somebody took a shot at me!
5,20,rachel:, really?!
5,20,ross:," no, a car backfired, but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me. and rach, i 'i survived! and i was filled with this this great respect for life. y'know? i i want to experience every moment. i want to seize every opportunity. i i am seeing everything so so clearly now."
5,20,rachel:, because a car backfired?
5,20,ross:," okay, why are you here?"
5,20,rachel:," well, i i i don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, emily called you today."
5,20,ross:, you talked to her?
5,20,rachel:," no, she left a message. but it it kinda got erased. there's just something wrong with your machine."
5,20,ross:," well, okay, what what did she say?"
5,20,rachel:," well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her."
5,20,ross:, wow!
5,20,rachel:," now, that that was a good thing that i told you, right?"
5,20,ross:," huh? yeah! yes, of course!"
5,20,rachel:," okay. thank you! thank you! becausei'm sorry, all right. because y'know what? she didn't want menot important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right. your decision."
5,20,ross:," right. i guess, i guess i should call emily."
5,20,rachel:," okay, no, that's not the right decision. that's not, that's not right, no ross ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that?"
5,20,ross:," okay, look, yesterday i would've even considered calling her back, but my ex wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience. i mean, that that has got to mean something!"
5,20,rachel:," ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience!"
5,20,ross:," you weren't there! okay, maybe this is something that i i'm supposed to seize! y'know?"
5,20,rachel:," okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff."
5,20,ross:, huh.
5,20,rachel:," i mean, look look today you escaped death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?"
5,20,ross:," that does make sense. because i do wanna seize some opportunity, but i i really don't wanna see or talk to her."
5,20,rachel:," well, there you go!"
5,20,ross:," yeah. maybe today is just, close call day."
5,20,rachel:, close call day.
5,20,ross:," hey, thanks rach. "
5,20,rachel:," ohh, honey no problem. okay. "
5,20,ross:, oh wait wait wait! the message is blinking. maybe you didn't erase it. 
5,20,rachel:, oh? 
5,20,ross:," ""hey ross, it's you!"" oh yeah, no that's that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that."
5,20,rachel:, no. 
5,20,ross:," hey umm, was was monica here?"
5,20,rachel:, yeah.
5,20,ross:," yeah, i want my money back."
5,20,rachel:," yeah, uh you you probably need that for stamps, right? ending credits "
5,20,ross:," hey pheebs, has gary ever been shot at for real?"
5,20,phoebe:," yes. once. yeah, a little. he kinda did it to himself. it's not really a good story."
5,20,ross:," i wonder how i would react under fire, y'know? and not backfire but but heavy fire, like i was in a war or something."
5,20,monica:," man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys."
5,20,chandler:, before or after you were shot by your own troops?
5,20,ross:, i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
5,20,chandler:," yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
5,20,joey:," yeah, hero sandwiches. "
5,20,phoebe:," well you all know that i'm a pacifist so i'm not interested in war in any way. but y'know what? when the revolution comes, i will have to destroy you all. not you joey. "
5,21,gary:," would you like some more coffee, baby doll?"
5,21,phoebe:," i'm fine, thanks."
5,21,chandler:," yeah, see, i can't pull of baby doll can i?"

5,21,gary:," tonight, but don't say anything. okay?"
5,21,monica:," i swear, i promise. i promise. oh my god, i'm so excited! {and i just can't hide it! i'm about to lose control and i think i like it! sorry, just couldn't resist it.} all right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. okay? because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral '"
5,21,gary:, i'll see you after work sweetie. 
5,21,phoebe:, okay. bye!

5,21,phoebe:, i can't believe this!
5,21,chandler:," right, because it's fast. because, it's so fast. it's fast!"
5,21,monica:, relax! it's phoebe! not you!
5,21,chandler:," oh! good for you pheebs, way to go! "
5,21,phoebe:," no, but it is fast. isn't it?"
5,21,monica:, ohhhh!
5,21,phoebe:," no, i like him a lot but i don't think i'm ready for this!"
5,21,chandler:," so, what are you gonna do?"
5,21,phoebe:, i don't know. i'll just handle iti'll ask you to talk to him!
5,21,chandler:, me?! why me?
5,21,phoebe:," because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him a 'man!"
5,21,chandler:," i'll try, but i'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? because i'm a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be."
5,21,monica:, that is so sweet! 
5,21,chandler:," still terrified, i'll take care of it. no problem. opening credits "
5,21,joey:," hey ross, is uh, is staten island really an island?"
5,21,ross:," uh huh, that's why they call it staten island."
5,21,joey:, ohhh. i thought it was like long island.

5,21,joey:," hey, what time is it?"
5,21,ross:, 2 .
5,21,joey:," wow! you realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?"
5,21,ross:, are you serious?!

5,21,rachel:, yes it is!
5,21,ross:, why is it inside out?!
5,21,rachel:," excuse me! but this is a purebred, show quality sphinx cat!"
5,21,ross:, how much did you pay for that?
5,21,rachel:," well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal."
5,21,ross:, yeah? how much?
5,21,rachel:, a thousand bucks.
5,21,ross:, on a cat??!!!!
5,21,joey:, it's not a cat!
5,21,rachel:," all right listen ball boys! my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!"
5,21,ross:," free cats do that too, y'know. {which reminds me, if i might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. if you want a leash, go to the pet shop. if you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. now back to regularly scheduled programming.}"
5,21,joey:, it's not a cat!
5,21,rachel:," ugh! look you guys, i'm really excited about this! okay? i don't care what you think! i'm gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson. well, what am i gonna call her? fluffy?! "
5,21,ross:," hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? huh?"
5,21,joey:," uhh, the ball thing."
5,21,ross:, yeah?
5,21,joey:," hey ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!"
5,21,ross:," uhh, yeah it would! let's do it!"
5,21,joey:, okay! 
5,21,joey:, uh oh.
5,21,ross:, what?
5,21,joey:, i have to pee. and rachel's in the bathroom! 
5,21,joey:," man, i didn't think we were gonna make it!"
5,21,ross:," the 5th precinct, gary's precinct, chandler has come to talk to him about commitment. and as he's walking through the door he notices a couple of ""ladies of the night"" sitting there. ]"
5,21,chandler:, hey ladies! what are you in here for? 
5,21,gary:," hey chandler, what are you doing here?"
5,21,chandler:," gary, i'm here to report a crime."
5,21,gary:, yeah?
5,21,chandler:, it is a crime that you and i don't spend more time together.
5,21,gary:, what's up?
5,21,chandler:," well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe, we should have a talk. man to uh, me."
5,21,gary:, sure. okay.
5,21,chandler:," uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live living together!"
5,21,gary:," yeah, i i considered that. i just know it would make me happy."
5,21,chandler:, you mean scared.
5,21,gary:," no, i mean happy."
5,21,chandler:, scared? happy?
5,21,gary:," chandler, what what are you doing?"
5,21,chandler:," i am trying to open your eyes, my man! don't you see, if you lived with phoebe she's always gonna be there. you're gonna get home, she's there. you go to bed, she's there. you wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
5,21,gary:, i know! i can't wait!
5,21,chandler:," were you're parents happy, or something?"
5,21,gary:," listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love. i justi wanna be around her as much as i can."
5,21,chandler:," wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
5,21,gary:," so you know what i'm talking about, right?"
5,21,chandler:," yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! maybe i should in with monica!"
5,21,gary:," no, it's too soon for you guys."
5,21,chandler:," yeah, you're right about that. "
5,21,ross:," 'now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws! how did it get there?! {y'know, sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up. but it won't work. i'll always have the last laugh! <manical_laugh.wav> okay, so maybe i'm a little deluded, it's probably just my spellchecker. but, i must admit i did get mesozoic and paleozoic on the first attempt. yay me! anyhoo '}"
5,21,joey:," maybe this should be more of a quiet game. {oh, all right!  geez, i can't have any fun!}"
5,21,monica:, hey guys!
5,21,joey:, hi!
5,21,monica:," joey, i left my watch on the counter last night. it was right here, where is it?"

5,21,monica:," all right, come on, i'm i'm late for work!"
5,21,ross:, how do you know? you don't have a watch.
5,21,monica:," guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!"
5,21,joey:," oh, i don't know '. yeah, can't do it. "
5,21,monica:, what?!
5,21,ross:," monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!"
5,21,joey:," yeah, we haven't dropped it in ' "
5,21,ross:," 2 hours, 27 minutes."

5,21,joey:," oh, don't worry, it's not a cat."
5,21,ross:, yeah.
5,21,rachel:," you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. i mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, i even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. and i swear, i know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me i know it's saying, ""rachel!"""
5,21,ross:, doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
5,21,monica:, what?! you paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
5,21,rachel:," well, i was gonna let you play with it. "
5,21,chandler:, hi!
5,21,phoebe:," hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing?"
5,21,chandler:," yes i did, and i think you should do it."
5,21,phoebe:, what?!
5,21,chandler:," he's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady."
5,21,phoebe:, you are useless! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! the one thing! and you can't even do that right! god!
5,21,chandler:," i'm sorry. if you ask me, i'd move in with him."
5,21,phoebe:," ohh!! god! ooh! get out of here, good for nothing."
5,21,gary:, hey chandler.
5,21,chandler:, hey gar!

5,21,gary:, here's the thing.
5,21,phoebe:, yeah?
5,21,gary:, y'know i really want to move this relationship forward.
5,21,phoebe:, uh hmm.
5,21,gary:," because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards."
5,21,phoebe:," no that's not true. if you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. and staying still is good. watch this. "
5,21,gary:, phoebe?
5,21,phoebe:, yeah?
5,21,gary:, i want you to move in with me.
5,21,phoebe:, that is so sweet. but don't you think it's a little too soon? i mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
5,21,gary:," oh. oh oh okay, i get it."
5,21,phoebe:, i justi don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
5,21,gary:, uh huh.
5,21,phoebe:, i really don't want to mess up what we have. i'm justi'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
5,21,gary:, yeah.
5,21,phoebe:, which is why my answer is yes!
5,21,gary:, really?!
5,21,phoebe:, uh huh! i'm so 'happy. commercial break 
5,21,ross:, monica! stop throwing it so hard! we're on the same team!

5,21,monica:, no no! don't do it! don't!
5,21,chandler:, what?
5,21,monica:, he's a dropper!
5,21,joey:," oh yeah, that's right!"
5,21,chandler:, i'm not a dropper!
5,21,ross:," it's really a uh uh three person game, y'know?"
5,21,chandler:, it's throwing and catching!
5,21,ross:, all right. 
5,21,chandler:, oh! oh! that's so hard. 
5,21,joey:," whoa whoa you guys, it's not a cat!"
5,21,monica:, oh myoh good god!
5,21,rachel:," i give up you guys, i don't know what i'm going to do with this thing!"
5,21,ross:," baking it didn't help, huh?"
5,21,monica:," so, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?"
5,21,rachel:, i tried! they won't take her back.
5,21,chandler:, maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti christ.
5,21,monica:," rach, why won't they take it back?"
5,21,rachel:," well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. i mean, what am i going to do, get a thousand regular cats?"
5,21,monica:," look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it."
5,21,rachel:," no mon that's not the point. i'm out a thousand dollars, i'm all scratched up, and i'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! "
5,21,monica:," oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!! oh god! okay. okay. it's okay. man, that was close."
5,21,chandler:, hey!

5,21,gary:, all right. 
5,21,monica:, so you're moving in with him. what happened?
5,21,phoebe:," i couldn't tell him no. he got so sad. maybe it'll be all right. i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money i'll save on stamps."
5,21,monica:," why, do you write him a lot?"
5,21,phoebe:," no, i just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. don't they?"
5,21,all:, yeah! that's right. yeah yeah! yeah! 
5,21,phoebe:," oh, i'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out. "
5,21,gary:," hey, honey! okay, so did you find any apartments? anything in brooklyn heights?"
5,21,phoebe:," no, nothing."
5,21,gary:, oh really?
5,21,phoebe:, yeah.
5,21,gary:, nothing at all?
5,21,phoebe:," no, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. unless it doesn't have a pool, i need a pool. "
5,21,gary:," phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?"
5,21,phoebe:, uh huh!

5,21,phoebe:," yeah, uh huh, there was nothing. can i get some water?"
5,21,gary:, in a minute. you you checked today's post?
5,21,phoebe:," umm, yeah! today's."
5,21,gary:," 'cause uh, this is today's post and uh, these are the listings i found. brooklyn heights, two bedroom. brooklyn heights, one bedroom. brooklyn heights, brooklyn heights, brooklyn heights!"
5,21,phoebe:, are these for rent! i thought people were just bragging!
5,21,gary:," let me tell you what i think might be going on. no no no, don't look at the table. look at me. okay, i think somebody asked someone to move in with them. and i think someone said, ""yes"" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. does that sound at all possible to you?"
5,21,phoebe:, yes. yes! fine! i am someone! you want me to say it? i have doubts! i'm sorry! 
5,21,gary:, phoebe '
5,21,phoebe:, yeah?
5,21,gary:," phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. i mean it is soon. and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and i just figure that everything i really like. and the things i don't know, i get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox."
5,21,phoebe:, that's so sweet.
5,21,gary:," sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. it's fine! we don't have to move in together. i justi want you to be happy"
5,21,phoebe:, living with you would make me happy.
5,21,gary:," phoebe, you don't have to say that."
5,21,phoebe:," no, i really wanna live with you! i wanna move in with you!"
5,21,gary:, are you sure?
5,21,phoebe:, yes. definitely! yes! let's live in an apartment that we both live in! 
5,21,gary:, oh that's great!

5,22,monica:," y'know what, i'm gonna hold her head."
5,22,rachel:, that's okay.
5,22,monica:, okay. 
5,22,rachel:, 1 '2! y'know what? you're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
5,22,rachel:," okay. you've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. i want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new."
5,22,rachel:," okay then, i guess we'll see you back here in three months."
5,22,rachel:, and i'll fit you for a glass eye.

5,22,chandler:, what?
5,22,monica:," i love you. {there's another continuity error here. before monica says i love you, chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. after she says the line and the camera cuts back to chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before. hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}"
5,22,joey:," man, i wish ross was coming with us! y'know? i'm gonna miss him!"
5,22,phoebe:, thanks a lot! i just got that jerk out of my mind!

5,22,joey:," uh no, not really. it's an independent film y'know? so we don't have a real big budget. i figured i'd just stay in your room."
5,22,chandler:," i see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? i mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
5,22,joey:," oh yeah! for every dollar shutter speed makes, one penny of it goes right in joey's pocket."
5,22,chandler:, so you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
5,22,joey:," did you not hear the plot of the movie? ""she's been dead for ten years."" i'm gonna be a millionaire!"
5,22,ross:, hey!
5,22,joey:, hey!
5,22,ross:," i just wanna say good bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? twenty bucks on black 15."

6,1,joey:, oh! tell her she's not marriage material.
6,1,chandler:, what?!

6,1,monica:, what are you guys gonna do?
6,1,rachel:," well, i guess we just find a divorce lawyer? "
6,1,chandler:," well, i think, i think, ross already has one. now, this one's free, right? because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free."
6,1,ross:," laugh it up, but the joke's on you. because we don't need to get divorced, okay? we we're just gonna get an annulment. "
6,1,joey:, an annulment? ross! i don't think surgery's the answer here.
6,1,phoebe:," oh oh, that's your thing."
6,1,ross:, what?
6,1,phoebe:, you're thing. you're thing. y'know? you're the guy who gets divorced.
6,1,all:, oh yeah!
6,1,ross:," no no, that's that's not my thing! i do not love getting divorced!"
6,1,phoebe:," yes you do! this is your third divorce! you love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. i'm so drunk. "
6,1,monica:," so, what do you think we should do?"
6,1,chandler:, i don't know. but i i i know i love you!
6,1,monica:, i know i love you! 
6,1,chandler:, so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? i love you.
6,1,monica:," that's a good question. look umm, last night we let the dice decide. maybe we should leave it up to fate again. i love you!"
6,1,chandler:," yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married."
6,1,monica:," all right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married."

6,1,monica:, wait a minute. that wasn't a hard eight! last night i rolled a hard eight.
6,1,chandler:," that's right! it was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! damnit!"
6,1,monica:, i wanted it so bad! wanna go pack?
6,1,chandler:," yeah. we're doing the right thing, right?"
6,1,monica:," ohh, of course we are! we left it up to fate. if we were supposed to get married there would be a clear cut sign. "

6,2,chandler:," look, i'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff."
6,2,joey:, yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
6,2,chandler:, not once did we do that.
6,2,monica:, hi.
6,2,chandler:, hey!
6,2,joey:, hi.
6,2,monica:," so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us."

6,2,monica:," really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didn't cry. she wasn't angry or sad. "
6,2,chandler:, and you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
6,2,monica:," i mean, all i'm asking for is just a little emotion! is that too much to ask after six years?! i mean what? are are are rachel and i not as close as you guys?! i mean do we not have as much fun?! don't i deserve a few tears?!! i mean we we told joey, he cried his eyes out!"
6,2,joey:, hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! it's like the end of an era! no more j man and channie's!! 
6,2,chandler:," okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?! "

6,2,ross:, yes.
6,2,russell:, so that's your second marriage in two years.
6,2,ross:," yes, second in two years. third overall."
6,2,russell:," ross, i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client. why don't you tell me what happened."
6,2,ross:," basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk '"
6,2,russell:," i'm sorry, is this the same rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?"
6,2,ross:," yes yes yes! but, i i do not love her."
6,2,russell:," oh, that's better then."
6,2,ross:, this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled.
6,2,russell:, i see. have you considered therapy?
6,2,ross:, i think just the annulment for today.
6,2,russell:, there are a couple of forms to fill out.
6,2,ross:, easy.
6,2,russell:," and we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind."
6,2,ross:, no problem.
6,2,russell:, and we'll need you and rachel to testify before a judge.
6,2,ross:," ooh! there's no way to do this without her? ''cause i kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
6,2,russell:," of course you did. look ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there."
6,2,ross:," uh ha, what about someone who looks like rachel? i will think about the therapy. "
6,2,rachel:, hey!
6,2,monica:," hey. so um, i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff."
6,2,rachel:, okay!
6,2,monica:," y'know, no point in dragging it out. dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore."
6,2,rachel:, okay.
6,2,monica:," hey rach, what about this? huh? who who gets this? see, i don't know if i want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!"

6,2,monica:," i don't know. hey, rachel, you want the big plate? i want you to have the big plate."
6,2,rachel:," wow! mon, thanks! i love this plate!"
6,2,monica:, something to remember me by!
6,2,rachel:," mon, honey you're not dying. i'm just moving out. y'know, i mean we're gonna see each other all the time."
6,2,monica:," but still, it's a big change. the end of an era, you might say!"
6,2,rachel:, are you okay? you're not blinking.
6,2,monica:," i'm fine! i just, i'm thinking how much it's an end of era."
6,2,rachel:," oh, all right. but y'know i gotta say, i don't, i don't think six years counts as an era."
6,2,monica:," an era is defined as a significant period of time. now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!"
6,2,rachel:, what is the matter with you?!
6,2,monica:, what is the matter with you?!! why aren't you more upset?! aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! i mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
6,2,rachel:," all right, fine, but don't get mad at me. it's it's just a little hard to believe."
6,2,monica:, what's hard to believe?
6,2,rachel:," well y'know, it's you guys. you you do this kind of stuff! y'know? i mean, you you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out! i guess i'm not upset because i don't see you guys going through with it. i'm sorry."
6,2,monica:," rachel, it's going to happen. chandler is gonna move in here."
6,2,rachel:, but i '
6,2,monica:," no no, wait! just let me finish, okay? this isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in in vegas, this is something we both really want. and it is going to happen."
6,2,rachel:, it is? really?
6,2,monica:," yeah, sweetie."
6,2,rachel:," i mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?"
6,2,monica:, no.
6,2,rachel:, what? oh my god! i'm gonna miss you so much! 
6,2,monica:, i'm gonna miss you! 
6,2,rachel:, i mean it's the end of an era!
6,2,monica:, i know! 
6,2,phoebe:," okay, bye!"
6,2,ross:, oh no.
6,2,phoebe:, so? did you get the annulment?
6,2,ross:, i couldn't.
6,2,phoebe:, i knew it! because you love rachel.
6,2,ross:, it's not that. okay? annulments are more complicated than i '
6,2,phoebe:," yeah, complicated ''cause of the love."
6,2,ross:," i ' i do, i do not love rachel. i'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. okay? would i do that if i loved her?"
6,2,phoebe:, i've never been more convinced of your love for her.
6,2,ross:, i do not have feelings for rachel! okay?! 
6,2,ross:," ohh, what's wrong?!"
6,2,rachel:, monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing.
6,2,ross:, oh mycome here! come here! it's okay. everything's gonna be okay.
6,2,rachel:, thank you.
6,2,ross:, of course. ending credits 
6,2,joey:," so, ross and rachel got married, monica and chandler almost got married, do you think you and i should hook up?"
6,2,phoebe:," oh we do, but not just yet."
6,2,joey:," really?! well, when?"
6,2,phoebe:," okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. yeah. but it won't work out."
6,2,joey:, wow.
6,2,phoebe:," i know. then, i'm gonna marry chandler for the money and you'll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids."
6,2,joey:, great!
6,2,phoebe:, but then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. we'll have chandler's money and rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachel's drinking problem.
6,2,joey:," oh oh, what about ross?"
6,2,phoebe:," i don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and i kill him."
6,3,chandler:, hey!
6,3,phoebe:, hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! 
6,3,joey:, dude! what are yoyou trying to kill me?!
6,3,rachel:," pheebs, i wanna ask you something."
6,3,phoebe:," uh huh, what?"
6,3,rachel:, well since i'm movin' out and and you're so beautiful '
6,3,phoebe:, oh!
6,3,rachel:, 'how about i move in with you?
6,3,phoebe:," well, that would be great but then what do we do about denise?"
6,3,monica:, who's denise?
6,3,phoebe:, my roommate.
6,3,rachel:, you have a roommate?!
6,3,phoebe:," yes, denise. denise! "
6,3,joey:," hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? huh? and what about this denise, is she cute?"
6,3,chandler:," pheebs, i don't understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?"
6,3,phoebe:, maybe because you never listen to anything that i say. i talk about her all the time! denise!!!!!
6,3,joey:," hey rach, listen i was thinkin' uh, i'm gonna have an extra room over at my place '"
6,3,rachel:," oh, that's true."
6,3,joey:," yeah, why don't you move in with me? it'll be great! we could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about naked thursday's right?"
6,3,rachel:," yeah, yeah i think i'm gonna find my own place."
6,3,chandler:, hey hey! i thought naked thursday's was just our thing man! opening credits 
6,3,phoebe:, hey.
6,3,ross:, hey!
6,3,phoebe:," so, what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?"
6,3,ross:," oh, that. umm, she took it really well."
6,3,phoebe:, you didn't tell her did you?
6,3,ross:, no. 
6,3,phoebe:," of course not, because you're in love with her."
6,3,ross:," i am not in love with her. she was very upset about having to move out so i eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. i i just comforted her, as a friend."
6,3,phoebe:," what do you mean, comforted her?"
6,3,ross:," it's nothing, i just gave her a hug."
6,3,phoebe:," ah ha! a classic sign of love, the hug!"
6,3,ross:, it's also a sign of friendship.
6,3,phoebe:," yeah, not in your case lovey loverson. "
6,3,ross:, it was a hug!
6,3,phoebe:," okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?"
6,3,ross:, s s smell her hair? what if i did?
6,3,phoebe:," ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! that's why, that's why women are shorter. so that men will fall in love when they hug them! oh come on ross, you're a scientist. "
6,3,ross:," i was hugging her as a friend. it's not my fault her her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all all uh 'coconutty. what?! oh, that doesn't mean i have feelings for rachel! maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts!"
6,3,phoebe:," okay, whatever you say. but just be careful, all right? rachel's not in the same place you are."
6,3,ross:," if the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place!"
6,3,phoebe:," okay, i didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's ''cause you were speaking the secret language of love! "
6,3,joey:," hey! dude, some guy just called for you."
6,3,chandler:, who was it?
6,3,joey:," i don't know! how about, ""thanks for taking the message."" jeez! "
6,3,monica:," okay listen, y'know when you move in rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?"
6,3,chandler:, sure!
6,3,monica:," okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! okay, whatever, i really haven't thought about it that much."
6,3,chandler:," well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe maybe maybe it could be a game room, y'know? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! the big big ones!"
6,3,monica:, no.
6,3,chandler:," okay so you mean no as in, ""gee chandler, what an interesting idea. let's discuss it before we reject it completely."""
6,3,monica:," oh, i'm sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no."
6,3,chandler:," so, that's it?"
6,3,monica:, i just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
6,3,chandler:, which is why asteroids is perfect! it's the oldest game!
6,3,monica:, what do you have against the beautiful guest room?
6,3,chandler:," i don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
6,3,monica:, are you mocking me?
6,3,chandler:," no, i'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room. "
6,3,joey:," hey, what's up?"
6,3,chandler:," nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight."
6,3,joey:," but you're still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today. "
6,3,chandler:," ""wanted. female roommate, non smoker, non ugly."" nice!"
6,3,joey:," yeah? i just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? someone i can learn from, someone someone who's different than me. and what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? enh? not just a hat rack my friend! "
6,3,rachel:," pheebs, i have to ask you '"
6,3,phoebe:, shhhhhh! i'm swamped right now.
6,3,rachel:, you're just staring into space.
6,3,phoebe:," umm, i'm trying to move that pencil. "
6,3,rachel:, this one? 
6,3,phoebe:, it worked!
6,3,rachel:," pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. i mean, look at this; ""wanted. female roommate, non smoker, non ugly."" it's just, there is nothing! the city's full!"
6,3,phoebe:," wait, no, look at this! ""two bedroom, two bath, must be non smoker, satan worshipers okay '"" oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor."
6,3,ross:, hey!
6,3,rachel:, hey.
6,3,ross:," rach, uh, you still looking for a place?"
6,3,rachel:, yeah! why?
6,3,ross:," okay, there's this guy, warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. so uh, you interested?"
6,3,rachel:, that sounds great! i'd love to live at warren's!! i love warren! thank you!
6,3,ross:," don't thank me! if you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. here's warren's number."
6,3,rachel:," oh, this is great! i am gonna call him right now! oh, thank you! "
6,3,ross:," okay, you go grab it!"
6,3,phoebe:, i saw it.
6,3,ross:, i don't know what you're talking about.
6,3,phoebe:," umm, i'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. you love her again; you re love her!"
6,3,ross:," look, i do not re love her."
6,3,phoebe:," i can't believe you won't just admit it! okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid."
6,3,ross:," look, we're just friends now! okay? why would i do anything stupid?"
6,3,rachel:," ugh!!! well, the apartment is already subletted! i mean, this is just hopeless. i'm never gonna find anything."
6,3,ross:, you can live with me.
6,3,rachel:, what?!
6,3,phoebe:, what?!
6,3,ross:, what? commercial break 
6,3,rachel:, oh my god! are you serious?!
6,3,ross:, uh huh. 
6,3,rachel:, i would love to live with you ross; that's that's great! thank you!
6,3,ross:," well, i'm i'm just glad i could, y'know, help you out."
6,3,phoebe:," wow! i'm i'm so happy for you guys. this is so so, not stupid."
6,3,rachel:," ross ross, you have no idea what this means to me! i mean, i mean i was gonna be homeless. you just saved me! you're my hero!"
6,3,ross:," hero, i uh, i don't knowwell, all right."
6,3,rachel:," oh, i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has! "
6,3,ross:," oh please! you're gonna say things now, aren't ya?"
6,3,phoebe:," no. no, i won't. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and that's how she ended up living with me! okay, that's a lie. "
6,3,chandler:, hi.
6,3,monica:, hi.
6,3,chandler:," hi, listen, i'm sorry about before. i don't need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldn't get girls, and now i can ''emnow, i have you. not not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women '"
6,3,monica:, stop it chandler. i'm sorry too.
6,3,chandler:, really?
6,3,monica:, yeah! oh yes!
6,3,chandler:, ohh.
6,3,monica:," listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together."
6,3,chandler:, that's a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
6,3,monica:, totally! 
6,3,chandler:, we don't have to come up with this now.
6,3,monica:, oh good.
6,3,chandler:," hey, y'know what? why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?"
6,3,monica:, changes?
6,3,chandler:," yeah, i mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. "
6,3,monica:, you're you're you're gonna bring the barca lounger over here?
6,3,chandler:, is that a problem?
6,3,monica:," well, it's a set and they should probably stay together."
6,3,chandler:," oh, that's cool. then i'll just bring them both over."
6,3,monica:, see now now you're taking them away from their home.
6,3,chandler:," okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! i'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!"
6,3,monica:," yeah yeah, y'know what? yeah, that's it that's it, everything will be mine! nothing will be yours! that's that's what i said! oh come on, chandler! i'm talking about the barca lounger! it just, it doesn't match! where is it gonna go?!"
6,3,chandler:, in the game room!
6,3,monica:, look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
6,3,chandler:, all right! that's fine! that's fine! i won't bring over the chairs! i won't bring anything over! i wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place!! 
6,3,joey:," oh don't worry, i'm not really a party girl."
6,3,joey:," whoa!! now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay?"
6,3,chandler:, you can call off the roommate search! hi! i'll be living here. 
6,3,joey:," oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i don't think he's gonna get it."
6,3,chandler:, why did you take the shower curtain down?
6,3,joey:, that thing was a hazard! i'm very safety conscious. 
6,3,rachel:, hey!
6,3,ross:," hey! oh listen, i was just clearing some space for your stuff."
6,3,rachel:," oh thanks, but listen, i was just at monica's and she and chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in."
6,3,ross:," what do you mean, they're not moving in? they they're still moving in right?"
6,3,rachel:," no no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room."
6,3,ross:, what?! over a stupid room!
6,3,rachel:," yeah, i feel kinda bad for them, but i'm also really psyched ''cause i don't have to move in here!"
6,3,ross:," oh no, yeah no, that part's great! "
6,3,ross:," what's all this about you guys fighting?! is this really over a room?! i mean, that is so silly!"
6,3,monica:," ross, we can handle this."
6,3,ross:," well, apparently not, and i can't just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness!"
6,3,chandler:," well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly! "
6,3,ross:," okay okay! two very good points, look i've known you both a long time, and i've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh what is more important, love or silliness?"
6,3,chandler:," well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
6,3,monica:, love is the best medicine.
6,3,chandler:, that's laughter.
6,3,monica:, why do you do it?
6,3,chandler:, i don't know.
6,3,ross:," okay! all right! now, chandler you you wanna live with monica, right?"
6,3,chandler:," yeah, i do."
6,3,ross:," and mon, you wanna live with chandler, don't ya?"
6,3,monica:, yes.
6,3,ross:, good! a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york! 
6,3,gunther:, so i understand you're looking for a place.
6,3,rachel:," no no, i'm staying put."
6,3,gunther:," oh, i was going to offer you my apartment."
6,3,rachel:," why, where are you going?"
6,3,gunther:, i don't know.
6,3,ross:, hey rach!
6,3,rachel:, hi!
6,3,ross:," you're never gonna believe it uh, monica and chandler are moving in again. that's great news righti mean for them. right?"
6,3,rachel:, oh wow.
6,3,ross:," yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again."
6,3,rachel:," yeah. y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?"
6,3,ross:," wh why?! why why why would it, why would it be weird?"
6,3,rachel:," well, because of us! because of our history."
6,3,ross:, no!
6,3,rachel:, no?
6,3,ross:," no! no! it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place?"
6,3,rachel:, no! not at all!
6,3,ross:, good! me neither! so it's not a problem. we're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
6,3,rachel:," okay, but ross, eventually you and i are gonna be dating."
6,3,ross:, really?! we are?
6,3,rachel:," yeah! i'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend '"
6,3,ross:, ohh! that would be great.
6,3,rachel:," but y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. y'know, it'll be like college, i'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""come back later, i'm gettin' lucky."" "
6,3,ross:," yeah, i didn't think of that. "
6,3,ross:, so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! i mean it's a really big step! and and what's the rush?! 
6,3,monica:, that's very funny!
6,3,chandler:," he's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
6,3,ross:," no, i i i'm serious, okay? i mean, think about it. you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!"
6,3,monica:," ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room."
6,3,ross:," okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isn't about the room, this is about what the room 'represents! and unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!"
6,3,chandler:," yeah, i'm not so worried."
6,3,monica:," yeah, no, me neither."
6,3,ross:," fine! it's your life! i just don't want to see you guys break up! which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing i can do. don't do it!!!!! "
6,3,monica:, you still want to move in together right?
6,3,chandler:, of course!
6,3,monica:, ross didn't scare you?
6,3,chandler:, scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
6,3,monica:," come here, i want to show you something!"
6,3,chandler:," okay! , the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.)"
6,3,chandler:, oh my god! someone's killed square man!

6,3,chandler:, oh that's so sweet! i want to show you something too!
6,3,monica:, okay!
6,3,chandler:," y'know those big big uh, road signs that say ""merge?"""
6,3,monica:, uh hmm.

6,3,monica:, oh my god! i love that!
6,3,chandler:, really?!
6,3,monica:," uh, no!! "

6,3,ross:, i've been back and forth.
6,3,joey:," yeah well, maybe you should go back! okay? rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! back together!"
6,3,ross:," ehh, i don't, i don't think so. she's already talked about y'know, dating other guys."
6,3,joey:," that's not gonna work out! then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, ""oh that's okay. you'll find someone."" and then, bamn! she finds you!"

6,4,chandler:, what?!
6,4,phoebe:," yeah, and i know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get."
6,4,monica:, phoebe that's crazy!
6,4,joey:, i can't believe she would say that too you.
6,4,rachel:, yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
6,4,phoebe:, i don'tshe said y'know that i'd have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black.
6,4,chandler:, just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
6,4,phoebe:," no, ''cause she didn't tell me i was gonna die until the very end of the session, and i was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! i mean i've only got a week left, y'know? i've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)"

6,4,ross:," ohh! okay! okay. ""there are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. each of these theories can be further subcategorized into '"""
6,4,chandler:, why don't you open with a joke?
6,4,ross:," open with a joke? it's a university, not a comedy club!"
6,4,chandler:," wait a minute, hold the phone! you're not talking about chuckles university?!"
6,4,ross:, okay!
6,4,all:," ohh! we're kidding! oh, we're kidding!"
6,4,rachel:," ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?"
6,4,ross:, thank you!
6,4,rachel:," some uh, some visual aides."
6,4,joey:, oh ooh ooh! y'know what's a good visual aide?
6,4,ross:, please don't say naked chicks.
6,4,joey:, why not?!
6,4,ross:, i i i don't even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it. y'know what? i'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.

6,4,chandler:, hey.

6,4,chandler:," ""benefits lapsed."""
6,4,joey:, hmm that's weird. i don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
6,4,chandler:," okay, it's not a check. they're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year."
6,4,joey:, let me see that!
6,4,chandler:, all right.
6,4,joey:," oh, i can't believe this! this sucks! when i had insurance i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? and it wouldn't matter. now i gotta be careful?!"
6,4,chandler:," i'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire."
6,4,joey:," all right well, i guess i gotta go get a job. i'm gonna go see my agent."
6,4,chandler:," okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
6,4,joey:, 'look both ways before you cross the street. 
6,4,phoebe:, hey!

6,4,rachel:," wow, that's great ross, i'm sorry we weren't more supportive before."
6,4,ross:," i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself. everyone's all, ""ross you have to be funny and sexy."" well, i proved them wrong! and now, i'm gonna pass the news onto joey and chandler."
6,4,monica:, that you're not funny or sexy?

6,4,estelle:," oh well, no harm, no foul."
6,4,joey:," estelle, you gotta get me some work. i i lost my health insurance."
6,4,estelle:," all right, first thing we gotta do, damage control."
6,4,joey:, why?
6,4,estelle:," well, i think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town."
6,4,joey:, bastard! 
6,4,chandler:, hey!
6,4,joey:, hey! so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and i'll have my health insurance back in no time.
6,4,chandler:," that's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?"
6,4,joey:, what?!
6,4,chandler:, what's wrong with you?
6,4,joey:," nothing! well, i i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. but um, i don't think it's anything serious."
6,4,chandler:, this sounds like a hernia. you have toyou you go to the doctor!
6,4,joey:," no way! ''kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! "
6,4,chandler:, that's a hernia.
6,4,joey:, why did i have to start working out again? damn you 15s! 
6,4,rachel:," well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes."
6,4,monica:," yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch."
6,4,rachel:," yeah, we could. oh hey look! there's some kappa kappa deltas! i was a kappa. hey sisters! wow, we really are bitches. "
6,4,ross:," right! so when rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! what he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. imagine his consternation when oh bloody hell. commercial break "
6,4,monica:, what the hell are you doing?!
6,4,ross:," look, i was nervous! you guys had me all worried i was going to be boring! i got up there and they were all like staring at me. i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out."
6,4,rachel:," yeah, and not a very good one."
6,4,ross:," dr. geller, kurt rathman, i'm a professor in the paleontology department here."
6,4,ross:, do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
6,4,ross:," i'm sorry, i've got plans with my sister."
6,4,monica:, monica gellerrr. 
6,4,ross:," right, will you excuse us for one moment? what are you doing?"
6,4,monica:," oh, you can have an accent and i can't?! top ''o the morning to ya laddies!"
6,4,ross:, just please stop! 
6,4,rachel:," yes, yes, bombay is bery, bery nice time of year. "
6,4,chandler:," hey, will you grab me a cruller? sit down! will you go to the hospital?!"
6,4,joey:," dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing."
6,4,chandler:, i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing 'pushed back in.
6,4,joey:," thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i don't want that hanging over my head. okay? besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want! yeah, i'm thinking i'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too. "
6,4,phoebe:, hey!
6,4,chandler:, hey.
6,4,joey:, hey!
6,4,phoebe:, what's going on?
6,4,chandler:," oh joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!"
6,4,joey:," look, i'm telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad."
6,4,phoebe:, hey! maybe you'll die!
6,4,joey:," sure, now i'm scared."
6,4,phoebe:," no, we can go together! just don't wait too long though, okay? ''cause i'm outta here sometime before friday."
6,4,joey:," yeah, but i don't wanna die!"
6,4,phoebe:," no no, it'll be fun! we can come back and we can haunt these guys! "
6,4,monica:, gimme ''em!
6,4,rachel:, no! they are mine!
6,4,monica:, you stole them from me!
6,4,rachel:, you stole them from me!!
6,4,monica:, gimme them! 
6,4,monica:, you just wanna each take one?
6,4,rachel:, yeah that seems fair. we never use them.
6,4,ross:," look, i really need some help, okay? why? why did i have to speak in a british accent?! what do i do?"
6,4,rachel:, well '
6,4,monica:," why don't you phase it out? yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in america."
6,4,rachel:," yeah, i mean, come on ross, no one will even notice. i mean they're probably not even listening!"
6,4,ross:, they're not listening too me?
6,4,rachel:, of course they're listening to you! everybody listens to you.
6,4,ross:, monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing?
6,4,monica:, whenever you're ready.
6,4,joey:," hold it. i'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less 'intense?"
6,4,joey:, oh my god!! 
6,4,joey:, that's where you pick up the bag.
6,4,joey:," no, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag."
6,4,joey:, no.
6,4,joey:," yeah, okay. "
6,4,joey:, you mean dying man?

6,4,rachel:," okay! ""hello ross, this is dr. mcneeley from the fake accent university, we'd like you to come on board with us full time! "
6,4,phoebe:, hey!
6,4,rachel:, hey!
6,4,phoebe:," listen to this! my reading was wrong, i'm not going die!"
6,4,rachel:, really?! how do you know?

6,4,rachel:," oh, i'm sorry."
6,4,phoebe:," eh, better her than me! hey, let's bake cookies! "
6,4,chandler:," listen, i'm really glad you got the part."
6,4,joey:, thank you.
6,4,chandler:, but are you sure you can do this?
6,4,joey:," yeah! and hey, thanks for coming with me. and thanks again for helping me take a shower. "
6,4,chandler:," now, is that never talking about it again?!"
6,4,joey:," hey joey, we're ready for ya! joey, this is alex he's going to be playing your son."
6,4,joey:, and action!

6,4,rachel:, hello? 
6,4,russell:," hello, is ross there?"
6,4,rachel:," uh no, he's not. can i take a message?"
6,4,russell:," yes, this russell, ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since i haven't heard from him, i assume he's decided to give the marriage a try."
6,4,rachel:, ross got married againnooooooo!!!!!!!!! 
6,4,ross:, what's happening to your accent?
6,4,ross:," come again? what's what's this nonsense? all right, i'm i'm not english. i'm from long island. i was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. i'm sorry. so, if we could just get back to the lecture. umm, were there any questions? about paleontology. all right, look i was just trying to make a good first impression. obviously, i screwed up. but what you guys think of me is really important because i'm i'm hoping to get a permanent job here. so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression ' "
6,4,rachel:," ross!! are you crazy?! i am still your wife!! what, were you just never gonna tell me?!! what the hell is wrong with you?!!!! ugh, i could just kill you!!!!"
6,4,ross:," chandler and joey's, joey is holding a football helmet; and apparently, in a rather disgusting scene, joey wants phoebe to beat him senseless. because he's made a miraculous recovery from his hernia and wants to take advantage of all those free surgeries he can get now since he's re established his health insurance.]"
6,4,phoebe:, have you really done this before?
6,4,joey:," yeah! yeah! yeah! you just take a big, big swing. now, don't hold back. and phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as chandler and monica enter.)"
6,4,phoebe:, hey!
6,4,joey:, hey hey hey!
6,4,chandler:, what are you doing?
6,4,phoebe:, we're just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back.
6,4,chandler:," oh, all right. "
6,5,rachel:, i cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
6,5,ross:, look i was going to tell you!
6,5,rachel:, when?! after the birth of our first secret child?! ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
6,5,chandler:, what?
6,5,monica:, you're kidding!
6,5,phoebe:, oh my god!!
6,5,monica:, ross!
6,5,ross:," okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. but i just couldn't face another failed marriage."
6,5,chandler:," okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
6,5,ross:," rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. okay, maybe it's best not to think about it."
6,5,phoebe:," okay, this is inexcusable. i am shocked to my very core!"
6,5,ross:," phoebe, i told her you already knew."
6,5,phoebe:, another lie. you have a sickness!
6,5,chandler:," ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya? opening credits "
6,5,joey:," oh come on! who would leave the keys to their porsche behind? if i had a porsche, i'd have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} hey gunther, these yours?"
6,5,gunther:," yeah, that's what i drive. i make four bucks an hour, i saved up for 350 years!"
6,5,joey:, na uh! hey did anybody lose their keys?
6,5,monica:," joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?"
6,5,joey:, there's a lost and found? my shoe! 
6,5,chandler:, you left a shoe here?!
6,5,joey:," well, i didn't realize until i got home. i wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! y'know what? i'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield. "
6,5,chandler:," oh good, when he comes back for his keys, i'll be sure to give him your shoe."
6,5,joey:, great! thanks. 
6,5,phoebe:," oh, good, good, you guys are here! listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!"
6,5,monica:," oh my god, what a fun day! that sounds great!"
6,5,chandler:," yeah, all right."
6,5,phoebe:," okay, well i'll bring them by tomorrow morning. okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're frank and alice's triplets. okay, see ya! "
6,5,chandler:, whoa whoa whoa! what?
6,5,phoebe:, please! please! please! please! oh please! please! please! frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and i'm nervous ''cause i've never done that before by myself!
6,5,monica:," don't worry about it phoebe, we'll absolutely do it."
6,5,chandler:," yeah, i'm gonna pass. ''cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies."
6,5,monica:, nice car!
6,5,joey:," yeah, it's not mine."
6,5,woman:, i love your car.
6,5,joey:," yeah, it's mine."
6,5,woman:, i bet it's fast.
6,5,joey:," me too! yeah. and comfortable. do uh, do you like leather seats?"
6,5,woman:, yeah!
6,5,joey:, it's got ''em! 
6,5,rachel:," so, i still have boxes here. i still have boxes at ross's, and i have nowhere to live! wow. i could so easily freak out right now."
6,5,phoebe:," what about me? i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while, i don't have a roommate."
6,5,rachel:," well, maybe maybe i could be your roommate pheebs."
6,5,phoebe:, maybe you could be my roommate!
6,5,rachel:, well there's an idea!!
6,5,phoebe:, yeah!
6,5,rachel:," that would be great! wait, how long is denise gone for?"
6,5,phoebe:," umm, she said she'd be back december 26th. "
6,5,rachel:," december 26th, huh maybe she's santa clause. "
6,5,rachel:," oh look who it is, my husband. the apple of my eye."
6,5,ross:," okay, i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2 and i picked up all the forms. i'll take care of everything."
6,5,rachel:," well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you. give me those forms! all right, now i'm gonna do this my way and i don't want to hear a peep out of you!"
6,5,ross:," okay rach, but '"
6,5,rachel:, op! you're peeping! 
6,5,rachel:," ross! y'know what, i just gotwhy? why did you do this?!"
6,5,ross:, look i told you '
6,5,rachel:," i don't wanna hear ""three failed marriages!"""
6,5,ross:," look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!"
6,5,rachel:," well, y'know what? thanks to you i'm half way there! ugh! oh! i am so mad! ross, i don't think i have ever been this angry!"
6,5,ross:, what about the time i said we were on a break?
6,5,rachel:, ugh! 
6,5,monica:," pheebs, how's it going?"
6,5,phoebe:, i'm doing okay. i think it's going well. do you think they're having fun? am i talking to fast?
6,5,monica:," nope, sound like me. pheebs, it's going great. look at chandler with little baby girl chandler."
6,5,chandler:," little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben. do you know what pheebs? when you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. "
6,5,phoebe:," na uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."
6,5,chandler:, see that's where i think that you're wrong. we've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
6,5,monica:, what do you mean?
6,5,chandler:," i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and y'know mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around ' "
6,5,phoebe:," that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping."
6,5,chandler:," okay, i'm a rookie. i should not be in the end zone. "
6,5,monica:, this is so great! this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
6,5,phoebe:, yeah? well this is not what i ordered.
6,5,joey:, hey guys!
6,5,chandler:, hey!
6,5,phoebe:, hey!
6,5,joey:," hey babies! oh, i'm having the best morning. that uh, that porsche i've got the keys too, still there!"
6,5,chandler:, shocking! since you still have the keys.
6,5,joey:," you should see the treatment i get when i'm with that car! people are friendly; they they wanna talk, and not just about the car! one guy gave me advice about my equity investments."
6,5,chandler:, what equity investments?
6,5,joey:," the ones that got me the porsche! will you keep up! but i figured, if if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that i don't own it. so i figured i'll wash it. right? monica, you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow?"
6,5,monica:," oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound."
6,5,chandler:, you don't even have a car!
6,5,monica:," i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so i washed it."
6,5,chandler:, and?
6,5,monica:, and six others.
6,5,chandler:, there you are. 
6,5,joey:, wow!
6,5,joey:, really! you got a place upstate?
6,5,joey:," well, i'll see you later."
6,5,joey:, hey! that's my car.
6,5,joey:, what what are you doing?
6,5,joey:, but it's my car!
6,5,joey:," listen, i i i don't come to this city much so i don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could i have my keys."
6,5,joey:, i'm not coming back.
6,5,joey:, i live upstate.
6,5,joey:," yeah, so did i. "
6,5,phoebe:, i don't know why i was so nervous about this. and i don't know why frank and alice are always complaining. this is so easy.
6,5,monica:," yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same."
6,5,chandler:," check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet krog! "
6,5,monica:," chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someone's eye out!"
6,5,chandler:, he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!
6,5,phoebe:," no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up."
6,5,chandler:," they're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"
6,5,phoebe:, what?!
6,5,chandler:," glass, sand, whatever. "
6,5,phoebe:," oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep."
6,5,monica:, oh it's so cute. i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
6,5,phoebe:," oh, i can still do that."
6,5,monica:, how are you still single?!
6,5,chandler:, all right. i thought about it and maybe you're right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.
6,5,monica:, good. what made you change your mind?
6,5,chandler:, i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
6,5,phoebe:, how did that happen?!!
6,5,chandler:," well, i was trying to prove that i was right. y'know? and it turns out i was wrong. and now it's lodged in my throat. "
6,5,monica:," damnit! y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler! "
6,5,judge:, okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
6,5,rachel:," yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out."
6,5,judge:, so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable.
6,5,ross:," fine, i'm mentally unstable."
6,5,judge:, and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user.
6,5,ross:, what?!
6,5,rachel:," uh yes, heroin and crack."
6,5,ross:, crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
6,5,rachel:," well, you would know."
6,5,judge:, now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
6,5,ross:," oh, come on!"
6,5,rachel:," ross, please, i found the magazines!"
6,5,judge:," and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin."
6,5,ross:," okay, i'm sorry, this is insane! i i i'm not addicted to heroin, i'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! look, i'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!"
6,5,judge:, that won't be necessary.
6,5,ross:, and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
6,5,rachel:, ugh!
6,5,judge:," now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem."
6,5,rachel:," ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! and could you strike ""consummated like bunnies"" from the record?"
6,5,judge:," is there, anything in this record that is actually true?"
6,5,rachel:," well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think."
6,5,judge:," well, based on what i heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. if you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce."
6,5,ross:," that's great! are you happy now? look what you did with your funny, funny form!"
6,5,rachel:, what?! me?! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
6,5,ross:, and what what are you typing that for? did you hear what she said? we don't get the annulment. don't type that! what?! stop typing! hey! stop typing! stop typing! stop typing!!
6,5,rachel:," okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!"
6,5,judge:, you need to get out of my chambers.
6,5,rachel:," all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one!"
6,5,ross:, yeah!
6,5,judge:, would you like to spend the night in jail?
6,5,rachel:, and thank you for your time. commercial break 
6,5,joey:, so the porsche guy took his car back.
6,5,chandler:, but you found the keys to his clothes?
6,5,joey:," no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche."
6,5,monica:, and people will think you own a porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
6,5,joey:, of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! right?
6,5,chandler:, that is true.
6,5,phoebe:," yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun."
6,5,joey:," oh, i've been there. yeah, i am gonna go drive my porsche. "
6,5,monica:," joey, you know you don't actually have one."
6,5,joey:, come on! what are you doing?! i'm in character! would you talk to her! 
6,5,chandler:," ahh, i think it just moved. it's really poking me."
6,5,monica:," all right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room."
6,5,phoebe:," what?! no, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! we're baby sitting! "
6,5,monica:," the babies are asleep, i'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!"
6,5,phoebe:, but you you can't leave me with them! we we're a team! we're playing a zone! they're gonna triple team me!
6,5,monica:," he's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital."
6,5,phoebe:," but no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
6,5,chandler:, i think that's gum.
6,5,phoebe:, i'm pretty sure it's gun.
6,5,chandler:," okay, listen this really hurts. let's go."
6,5,phoebe:," a real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! no! what would, what would krog do? "
6,5,joey:, why isn't that valet back with my porsche?
6,5,passerby:, maybe because you've got the keys?
6,5,joey:, porsche. 
6,5,rachel:, this is totally your fault!
6,5,ross:, my fault?! you threatened the judge!
6,5,rachel:," well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!"
6,5,ross:, that was the only way i could get him to stop typing!
6,5,joey:, hi! how are the gellers? 
6,5,rachel:, don't call us that! 
6,5,ross:, the judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! now we gotta get a divorce!! did a porsch throw up on you? 
6,5,joey:, hey! it's porsche!! 
6,5,phoebe:," me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, i'm gonna take that spit bubble as, ""yeah, i do!"" okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, i'll set you up with a clean one. okay, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up. okay? ''cause let's face it, we're at monica's. i broke it. all right. well, that's just the way that goes. okay, good. why are there only two of you? where is leslie? well, you can't answer. leslie? where are you leslie? leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! well, look at you! hey! you are a little bit mischievous! my gosh! oh, you're a lot mischievous! well, it'll dry. okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowwho aren't there! "
6,5,chandler:, hey!
6,5,phoebe:, how do you feel?
6,5,chandler:," well, let's just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
6,5,phoebe:," okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed ''em, bathed ''em, and put ''em to bed."
6,5,chandler:, and protected them from a tornado? 
6,5,monica:, oh my god.
6,5,phoebe:," i know, the babies are asleep."
6,5,monica:," phoebe, what, what happened here?!"
6,5,phoebe:, i did it! i took care of the babies all by myself!
6,5,monica:, but my apartment!
6,5,chandler:, was the setting of phoebe's triumph.
6,5,monica:, but the mess!
6,5,chandler:, is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
6,5,monica:," you're right, you're right i shouldn't freak out. ''cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be?!"
6,5,chandler:," phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! "
6,5,rachel:," oh honey thank god you're home, i was getting worried."
6,5,ross:," i picked up the divorce papers. uh, i've already signed everything and i put little ''x's where you need to sign."
6,5,rachel:," oh, little ''x's! great! that makes up for everything!"
6,5,ross:," y'know, i iyou've done a lot of stupid stuff too! okay?"
6,5,rachel:," oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!"
6,5,ross:," okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding! ah, how about you told me you loved me after i was already married!"
6,5,rachel:, hey! wait a minute! that was different! i did those things because i was in love with you!
6,5,ross:, yeah! right! 
6,5,ross:," you're right. that's very different. so let's, let's just sign the papers. all right? what?"
6,5,rachel:, nothing. 
6,5,ross:," okay, can we just sign please?"
6,5,rachel:, uh hmm. 
6,5,ross:, congratulations. 
6,5,rachel:," okay ross, we'rewait a minute. umm, i uh, i kinda have a little confession."
6,5,ross:, what?
6,5,rachel:," well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea."
6,5,ross:, excuse me?
6,5,rachel:," well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?"
6,5,ross:, yeah?
6,5,rachel:," and uh, yeah, i didn't really, i didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. and uh, and i thought it would be funnier if we got married. so as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. so umm, sorry i got us into this mess."
6,5,ross:," so then if ifi mean if you think about it, this is all your fault."
6,5,rachel:," yeah, don't push it though."
6,5,ross:," i've got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women, never thought i would be divorcing you."
6,5,rachel:," i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at pizza hut. "
6,5,ross:," did i, did i even treat?"
6,5,rachel:," no, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special."
6,5,ross:, that may be the most depressing thing i've heard in my life. i should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
6,5,rachel:," hey, thanks ross, for taking care of all of this."
6,5,ross:," eh, no problem. "
6,5,rachel:, i'm gonna need a copy of those.

6,6,joey:, oh my god!!
6,6,chandler:," that's our phone number. now look, i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't i justwhy don't i just cover you for a while?"
6,6,joey:, no no! no way! joey tribbiani does not take charity 'anymore.

6,6,chandler:," no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it."
6,6,phoebe:," well, how much do you think he needs?"
6,6,chandler:," i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? but i have to trick him into taking it so i won't hurt his pride."
6,6,phoebe:, why don't you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want.
6,6,chandler:, well that would help the pride thing.
6,6,monica:, hey!
6,6,chandler:, hey! wow! you look great! wanna move in with me tomorrow?
6,6,monica:, okay.
6,6,chandler:," okay! so, what do you girls have planned for tonight?"
6,6,monica:," well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that rachel is moving in with phoebe."
6,6,phoebe:," and also, my birthday."
6,6,monica:, it's not your birthday.
6,6,phoebe:, what a mean thing to say! i would never tell you it's not your birthday!

6,6,ross:," whoa whoa whoa, knicks season opener tonight. i thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it."
6,6,joey:," i don't know ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist."

6,6,chandler:," say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. what do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
6,6,joey:," what, are you crazy? you haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. it would be easier if you just give me your money."
6,6,chandler:, yes it would. what do you say to $50?

6,6,rachel:," i'm sorry pheebs, i guess i'm just really said that i'm leaving."
6,6,monica:, i'm gonna miss you so much.
6,6,phoebe:," well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. y'know? maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss."
6,6,monica:, i don't think there's anything.
6,6,phoebe:," come on, there's gotta be something."
6,6,monica:," nope, she's perfect."
6,6,rachel:, i have one.
6,6,phoebe:, good! great! you can go first.

6,6,phoebe:," good that's a good one. okay, monica, anything? y'know? does rachel move the phone pen?"
6,6,monica:," aw, sometimes. always, actually."

6,6,joey:, really?
6,6,chandler:," hey, i didn't make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you getno way! "
6,6,monica:," well, this is the last box of your clothes. i'm just gonna label it, ""what were you thinking?"""

6,7,ross:," whoa, hello, did you just meet monica?"
6,7,chandler:," she is gonna recognize that i did a nice thing and and, appreciate it."
6,7,ross:," hmm you know, actually this'll work out well. cause when you have to move back in with joey, joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me."
6,7,chandler:," i see, i see, y y you're trying to freak me out."
6,7,ross:," look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. believe me, i lived with her for 16 years. she is going to freak 'out. oh my god, she's going to sit on you."
6,7,chandler:," no, she's not okay? and i'll prove it to you. i'm gonna call her right now. phone's done ehh."

6,7,monica:," terrible. if if i want something done right, i have to do it myself. other people just wreck stuff. i really think i might kill someone tonight. "
6,7,chandler:," oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
6,7,monica:, it's worse. the only thing that's getting me through is knowing that i'm gonna be seeing you soon. i think i may even try to get out of here early.
6,7,chandler:, no! no no no no no no. it sounds like they really need you down there.
6,7,monica:,"  well, are you just hanging out with ross?"
6,7,chandler:," it's, all good! okay bye bye mon! she's she's gonna kill me."
6,7,ross:," yeah, the phone was facing the other way. and that goes back up there. commercial break "
6,7,chandler:," we should start with the big stuff. y'know? that'll be the easiest. uh, let's start with the couch. i got it. "
6,7,ross:," yeah that that, doesn't look right."
6,7,chandler:," what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... ok, ok, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table."
6,7,ross:," whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet."
6,7,chandler:," ok well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."
6,7,ross:," whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area."
6,7,chandler:," yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...rooosss!!!!"
6,7,joey:," look, what am i gonna do? i'm not flirting but still, i'm drawing her to me like like a moth to a flame! what the hell's going on over here?!?!? monica's gonna kill you! look i need your help, i have to do something to to repel this woman! wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. "
6,7,ross:," hey, i've been married 3 times "
6,7,joey:," no no no i've seen it happen, you you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. what's your secret?"
6,7,ross:," look, we do not repel women ok? that is completely untrue."
6,7,chandler:," oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine?"
6,7,ross:," yeah, well what about you? you weren't you know, so hot in college either. after everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh"" "
6,7,chandler:," yeah, monica doesn't like that either, maybe i should stop doing that."
6,7,ross:," oh y'know what, girls don't like it when i start talking about science."
6,7,chandler:, that's not specific to girls.
6,7,joey:," this is great, this is great, what else, what else?"
6,7,ross:," uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar."
6,7,chandler:, and they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
6,7,ross:, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
6,7,chandler:," man, i'm so lucky i have monica."
6,7,ross:, i'm never gonna find love again. 
6,7,rachel:," hey phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?"
6,7,phoebe:, sure 
6,7,rachel:," okay, um, i... all right phoebe look, i just wanted to say that i'm sorry. ok? i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you. "
6,7,phoebe:," so, what should you have done?"
6,7,rachel:," well, i i should've told you the truth."
6,7,phoebe:," uh huh, which is...?"
6,7,rachel:," well, y'know, the reason i didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little... "
6,7,phoebe:, so?
6,7,rachel:," well, it's embarrassing. people were looking at us like we were crazy."
6,7,phoebe:, why do you care?
6,7,rachel:, because they're people.
6,7,phoebe:, but people that you don't know and will never see again.
6,7,rachel:," yes, but still. they're people 'with eyes."
6,7,phoebe:," well, i didn't get embarrassed running next to miss . but no, okay. no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. yeah, okay. you're uptight."
6,7,rachel:," i i am not uptighthey hey hey oh oh! listen, i am not uptight, man."
6,7,phoebe:," that's okay rachel. i'm not judging you; that's just who you are. me. i'm more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. y'know, i mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan? the neighbor's dog. "
6,7,chandler:," okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
6,7,ross:, who cares? i repel women. 
6,7,chandler:, no no no no no no no no!!! you can't come in here! r r r r ross is naked.
6,7,monica:, what?!
6,7,ross:, what?!
6,7,chandler:, i couldn't say that i was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
6,7,ross:, why does anyone have to be naked?
6,7,monica:, why is ross naked?
6,7,ross:, i i had to show chandler something?
6,7,monica:, naked?
6,7,ross:," yeah yeah i uh, i have a uh, a guy problem."
6,7,monica:, is it the same thing that chandler had?
6,7,chandler:," look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later."
6,7,monica:," okay, listen, there's still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. bye!"
6,7,chandler:, bye! thank god
6,7,ross:," dude, what'd you have?"
6,7,chandler:," look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we gotta get everything back into its original place."
6,7,ross:, the photo album! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. we just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
6,7,chandler:, that's perfect! that's brilliant! 
6,7,ross:," so really, what'd ya have? "

6,7,joey:," pizza, heh, its not like i never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh."
6,7,janine:, is there something wrong?
6,7,joey:," all right, all right, let's just get this out in the open okay? you're hot. i'm lovable. clearly there's a vibe going on between us. but, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road."
6,7,janine:, joey...
6,7,joey:," no, no, no, i'm telling ya. imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? so the question is, what do we do?"
6,7,janine:," well, i don't think there is anything to do. i mean i think you're really sweet, but i'm just not interested in you like that."
6,7,joey:, oh!
6,7,janine:," no! i mean you're a really nice guy and i'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, i'm just y'know, i just don't feel that way about you."
6,7,joey:," oh! i see what happened. it's because i was trying to repel you. right? believe me, you'd feel a lot different if i turned it on."
6,7,janine:, i don't think so.
6,7,joey:," oh, i do. how you doin?"
6,7,janine:, i'm ok

6,7,chandler:, uh huh
6,7,monica:, why is everything different?
6,7,ross:, bye! 
6,7,chandler:," no, i don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. "
6,7,monica:," well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets."
6,7,chandler:," okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i i i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and i'm sorry, i'm very sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry."
6,7,monica:," it's okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something? "
6,7,chandler:, do you want me to be afraid of you?
6,7,monica:," of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it. i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place, but i'd never expect you to worry about that."

6,8,monica:," wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer."
6,8,chandler:," yes, but i feel like i've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. you know. in fact i think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple."
6,8,monica:," you know what? this has been kind of a girlie day. you're right, i'm sorry."
6,8,chandler:," nah, nah, it's okay. i feel like i need to be in guy place. you know, do kind of like a man thing."

6,8,kim:, hi rachel.
6,8,rachel:," yeah, remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday? well it didn't happen."
6,8,kim:, you didn't cancel the fabric order from taiwan?
6,8,rachel:," okay, two things didn't happen. remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room? well, it turns out that's not true."
6,8,kim:, that's not true?
6,8,rachel:, no.
6,8,kim:," oh that's interesting? because i checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, rachel."
6,8,rachel:," oh no, no, no. oh god, you think i made out with him."
6,8,kim:, listen to me. if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job. you are sadly mistaken.
6,8,rachel:, i i don't want your job. i i don't. ohh this is such a mistake. i did not make out with him. nobody made out with him. i did not use my keycard yesterday. i don't even know how to use my keycard. 
6,8,kim:, hi kim. 
6,8,kim:," yeah, nothing happen. you could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife. "
6,8,hillary:," and after that, what could i do except become a chef."
6,8,ross:, mmm hmm.
6,8,hillary:," and someday soon, i hope to open my own restaurant."
6,8,ross:, mmm.
6,8,hillary:," you know, you're a really great listener. most guys i go out with, they just talk and talk."
6,8,ross:, mm hmm.
6,8,hillary:," after a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?"
6,8,ross:, hmm hmm.
6,8,hillary:, i've probably been talking too much. why don't we talk about you a little bit?
6,8,ross:, mmm unmm.
6,8,hillary:, come on. i want to know.
6,8,ross:," hmm hmm hmm. okay. i, uh, am from long island. i i came to the city for college. um, i, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time i like to read spy novels. but, but, let's talk more about you. hmm. "
6,8,joey:," so what's really neat. if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer."
6,8,monica:," oh my god, joey, that is such a great tip."
6,8,chandler:," monica, could you excuse us for a second? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers."
6,8,monica:," okay. oh but joey, come over later because i'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter."
6,8,joey:," ohh, i love birds. "
6,8,chandler:, what is the matter with you ?!?
6,8,joey:, what?
6,8,chandler:," you're arranging flowers! you got dead flowers! you got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! this is not joey!!"
6,8,joey:," hey. hey look i am still joey, okay. flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. of a famous baby."
6,8,chandler:, you're turning into a women.
6,8,joey:, no i'm not. why would you say that? that's just mean.
6,8,chandler:, now i've upset you? what did i say?
6,8,joey:," it's not what you said. it's the way you said it '.oh my god, i'm a women!!! "
6,8,rachel:," now, she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job."
6,8,phoebe:, but why didn't you just tell her the truth.
6,8,rachel:, i did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren.
6,8,phoebe:," well, hey, what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? you know. what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man? huh, did she ever think of that?"
6,8,rachel:," you were with kenny today, weren't you?"
6,8,phoebe:, just for a second.
6,8,rachel:," ohh, phoebe, what am i going to do?"
6,8,phoebe:," well, the only thing you can do. sleep with ralph lauren."
6,8,rachel:," i'm not going to sleep with ralph lauren. i mean, i could, but i wouldn't."
6,8,phoebe:," ohh, sleep with kenny."
6,8,rachel:, that wouldn't help me.
6,8,phoebe:," ohh, yes it would. "
6,8,hillary:, i've had a really good time tonight.
6,8,ross:, mmm.
6,8,hillary:," you know, i rarely connect with someone this much on the first date."
6,8,ross:," hmm hmm hmm. me, neither. i've had a really good time too, you know. "
6,8,hillary:, are you going to eat that bread?
6,8,ross:," ohh, i just like the smell. mmmm."
6,8,hillary:, you make me laugh.
6,8,ross:, hmm hmm.
6,8,hillary:, would you like to move over to the couch?
6,8,ross:, mmm hmm. 
6,8,hillary:, maybe i'll just turn the lights down a little.
6,8,ross:, how about all the way.
6,8,hillary:, okay. 
6,8,ross:," wow, cool poster. or should i say groovy poster? so, ahh, where were we?"
6,8,hillary:, are those your teeth??
6,8,ross:," ohh, you can see them, huh?"
6,8,hillary:, yes. they're insanely white.
6,8,ross:," i i, did that for you."
6,8,hillary:, what's a matter with you?
6,8,ross:, what's a matter with me? you've got a black light. it's 1999! 
6,8,rachel:," kim, hi."
6,8,kim:," hi rachel. ohh, i've been meaning to ask you. have you seen the new ralph lauren sheets? ohh, what am i thinking. of course you have."
6,8,rachel:, okay..okay.. look. i'm sorry that i lied to you before. you were right. ralph and i were an item but were not anymore.
6,8,kim:," oh, really?"
6,8,rachel:," yeah, he dumped me. he said, ""rachel, i can't do this. even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. i can't do this. i'm married and i'm sorry."" and then i don't know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted. especially not above kim, who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine."""
6,8,kim:, hi kim. 
6,8,kim:, oh my god. he just gave you the coldest look i have ever seen. it's like he hates you. then it is true.
6,8,rachel:, of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
6,8,kim:, ohh honey come here. ohh it will be ok. we've all been there.
6,8,rachel:, you and ralph?
6,8,kim:, kenny the copyboy. ending credits

6,8,janine:, what's the matter? are you upset?
6,8,joey:," i'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. i, uh, i got to be a man! okay. the living room has to remain a guy place, okay? that's just the way it has to be."
6,8,janine:," well, if that's what you want. i'll just put it all in my room."
6,8,joey:," great 'great 'and thanks for being so understanding. i mean, i didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. i mean, if you want to."
6,8,janine:, okay.
6,8,joey:," and, uhh, maybe the watering can there."

6,9,chandler:," oh! that's great, they haven't seen the place since i moved in! "
6,9,monica:," yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , i was thinking we would eat around four. "
6,9,chandler:, why can't i tell them that we live together?
6,9,monica:, because they don't know we're dating. do you think we should eat in the kitchen? 
6,9,chandler:, why haven't you told them?!
6,9,monica:," um, well, i was going to, i i i really was. but um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, i didn't."
6,9,chandler:, why haven't you told them?! wouldn't they be happy?!
6,9,monica:, so! dinner in the kitchen around four! i'll see you then. 
6,9,chandler:, why wouldn't they be happy?
6,9,monica:," well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. i'm sorry."
6,9,chandler:, what? what? why?!
6,9,monica:," maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch."
6,9,chandler:, is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
6,9,monica:," look, i know that i should've told them. i know i shouldn't care what they think. i'm sorry. "
6,9,chandler:," y'know, it'll be okay. it'll be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell ''em."
6,9,monica:, you really think that'll work?
6,9,chandler:," hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, didn't i?"

6,9,ross:," yeah, they don't like you."
6,9,chandler:, do you know why?
6,9,ross:," i dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. or maybe it's cause you uh "
6,9,chandler:, well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess! 
6,9,chandler:," this is great, another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
6,9,joey:," maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?"

6,9,joey:," ye ye, we go to yours!"
6,9,ross:," yeah, see, we we we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. but, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. yeah, you you should tell your friends that."

6,9,all:, hi! 
6,9,monica:," oh yes of course, hello chandler."
6,9,chandler:," mr. and mrs. geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats! "
6,9,chandler:, no. 
6,9,monica:, my joke wasn't funny. 
6,9,phoebe:," rach, rach, i just remembered. i had a dream about mr. geller last night."
6,9,rachel:, really?!
6,9,phoebe:," yeah, i dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! and it's making me look at him totally differently. y'know, i mean he used to be just, y'know jack geller monica and ross's dad and now he's he's jack geller, dream hunk."" "
6,9,rachel:," i dunno. y'know to me he'll always be jack geller, walks in while you're changing. "
6,9,monica:," y'know dad, chandler is one of ross's very best friends!"
6,9,chandler:," i always thought that too. tell me, what does your father do? "
6,9,chandler:, he's the headliner of a gay burlesque show. 
6,9,joey:," rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? those drunken dancers are waiting! "
6,9,rachel:," look at it, isn't it beautiful?"
6,9,ross:," yeah, yeah, what is it?"
6,9,rachel:," it's a truffle. it's got all of these layers. first there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch, "
6,9,ross:, w what was the one right before bananas?
6,9,rachel:," the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, y'know, i thought well, there's mincemeat pie, i mean that's an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place?"
6,9,joey:, y sure!
6,9,rachel:, okay. 
6,9,ross:," beef in a dessert?! i no no no, there is no way! "
6,9,joey:," i know, and only one layer of jam?! what is up with that? "
6,9,ross:," oh my god, the pages are stuck together!"
6,9,joey:, chandler!
6,9,ross:," oh my god, she she made half a english trifle, and half a...sheperd's pie!"
6,9,joey:, oh man! now she's gonna start all over! we're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
6,9,ross:," no, no, we will. we just won't tell her she messed up."
6,9,joey:, just let her serve the beef custard thing?
6,9,ross:," yeah, it'll be like a funny thanksgiving story!"
6,9,joey:, vomiting stories are funny... 
6,9,rachel:," joey, god, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!"
6,9,joey:, did did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
6,9,rachel:, no!
6,9,joey:, still not hot enough! 
6,9,phoebe:, rachel?
6,9,rachel:, yeah?
6,9,phoebe:," okay, look at him. look at those strong hands. oh what i wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk. "
6,9,monica:," oh, thank you chandler! i just bought it."
6,9,chandler:, i think he's stoned again.
6,9,chandler:, what?
6,9,monica:, what?
6,9,ross:," dude, i need to talk to you a sec. "
6,9,ross:," okay, i think i might know why my parents don't like you."
6,9,chandler:, you do? why?
6,9,ross:," okay, remember, we were young. hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window."
6,9,chandler:, what?! why did you do that?
6,9,ross:," i don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that that popped into my head, i'm i'm sorry. i i didn't think it would matter."
6,9,chandler:, how could it not matter?!
6,9,ross:," how was i supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you you would be living with my sister?"
6,9,chandler:, what about all that friends forever stuff?
6,9,ross:," i don't know, i i was all high. commercial break "
6,9,monica:, mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get ross stoned!
6,9,chandler:, your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
6,9,monica:," ross, i can't believe you'd do that!"
6,9,chandler:," the reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this?"
6,9,ross:," okay, okay, i'll tell ''em it wasn't chandler who got high. now who should i say it was?"
6,9,monica:, you! it's not like it's a big deal! you you don't still do it or anything!
6,9,ross:," alright, alright, now now who should i say tricked me into doing it? "
6,9,monica:," dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the "
6,9,phoebe:," monica, leave him alone! "
6,9,joey:, will you hurry up? did you not hear me before when i told you that all of janine's friends are dancers?! and that they're going to be drinking alot!?
6,9,rachel:," no, i did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic."
6,9,joey:, well you're whippin' so slow! can't you do it any faster?
6,9,rachel:," joey! come on! i don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's gonna be like oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle? "
6,9,rachel:," so why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?"
6,9,joey:, oh i am! 
6,9,monica:," ross, if you don't tell them, then i will!"
6,9,ross:," okay, fine! "
6,9,joey:, ross! can i talk to you for a second?
6,9,ross:," oh, uh, can it wait a second joey? i have to tell my parents something. no it can't? okay. "
6,9,joey:," okay, look, i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert."
6,9,ross:," what?! what is with everybody? it's thanksgiving, not...truth day!"
6,9,joey:," look, when everyone eats that...that...banana meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?"
6,9,ross:," okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. that that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie! "
6,9,joey:," dude, they're not objects. "
6,9,joey:," just kiddin,' i'll talk to them, you distract rach. "
6,9,ross:," hey rach, can i talk to you outside for a second?"
6,9,rachel:, okay... 
6,9,rachel:," what's up, ross?"
6,9,ross:," so um...thanksgiving. the holiday season is upon us, hm? "
6,9,rachel:, yeah!
6,9,ross:, and um...you look nice today.
6,9,rachel:," oh no. no ross, don't do this."
6,9,ross:, what?
6,9,rachel:, i just i don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
6,9,ross:, eh?
6,9,rachel:," i thought this might happen today. ross, i know the holidays can be rough. y'know? and it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now."
6,9,ross:, you're alone.
6,9,rachel:," no, i i live with phoebe. i mean you're alone, alone. and i just it's just not the time for us. i'm sorry."
6,9,ross:," ah well, can't blame a guy for trying! "
6,9,joey:," oh and okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, i learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! and smiling , okay?"
6,9,chandler:," yeah, i'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. "
6,9,joey:," rachel, there you are! come on, let's serve that dessert already!"
6,9,rachel:," joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? you don't get any dessert."
6,9,joey:, really?
6,9,rachel:," no, i'm just kidding i would never do that to you! okay, everybody, it's trifle time!"
6,9,phoebe:," so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, isn't it?"
6,9,rachel:, it sure is.
6,9,phoebe:, wow. so then did you make it with beef or eggplant?
6,9,rachel:, beef.
6,9,phoebe:, i can't have any. you know i don't eat meat. ohhh no. 
6,9,rachel:," alright, monica, i want you to have the first taste."
6,9,monica:, really? 
6,9,rachel:," oh oh oh, wait! you only got whipped cream in there! ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!"
6,9,monica:, okay. 
6,9,rachel:," op! wait, you dropped a pea. "
6,9,rachel:, well?
6,9,monica:, mmmm! it's good!
6,9,rachel:, really? how good? 
6,9,monica:," it's so good, that i feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is. especially ross. "
6,9,all:, mmm.
6,9,chandler:, i'll help you dial. 
6,9,monica:," i'm gonna go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror, as i eat it. "
6,9,rachel:," okay, now what was that all about? is it does it not taste good? let me try it. "
6,9,ross:, wha? no no! ah! all gone! so good! maybe chandler has some left. 
6,9,ross:, it tastes like feet!
6,9,joey:, i like it.
6,9,ross:, are you kidding?
6,9,joey:, what's not to like? custard? good. jam? good. meat? gooooood. 
6,9,rachel:," ...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street? "
6,9,chandler:," yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it. "
6,9,phoebe:," rachel, come here. okay, i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap, and i had another dream about jack."
6,9,rachel:," oh, phoebe, do i wanna hear this?"
6,9,phoebe:," i dunno, let's see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl."
6,9,rachel:," oh my god, he dream cheated on you!"
6,9,phoebe:," boy, i'm glad i wore the big belt today."
6,9,phoebe:," five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. now nothing. well, not nothing, i am still a woman. "
6,9,monica:, ross? let's go.
6,9,ross:," oh yeah, about telling mom and dad, i was thinking about maybe writing a letter."
6,9,monica:," alright, you know what? that's it. you've had your chance."
6,9,ross:, wha what?
6,9,monica:, what?!
6,9,ross:, yes. 
6,9,ross:, it was you?
6,9,monica:," and dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? he didn't steal your playboys! ross did! "
6,9,ross:," yeah, well, hurricane gloria didn't break the porch swing, monica did! "
6,9,monica:, ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year! 
6,9,ross:, monica and chandler are living together! 
6,9,monica:, ross married rachel in vegas! and got divorced! again!!!! 
6,9,phoebe:, i love jacques cousteau!
6,9,rachel:, i wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
6,9,joey:, what happened son?
6,9,ross:," chandler! you've been ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. and now you've taken on monica as well. well, i don't know what to say. you're a wonderful human being. "
6,9,chandler:," no! thank you! monica, and ross! i don't know what i'm gonna do about the two of you!"
6,9,chandler:, i'll talk to them! closing credits 
6,9,rachel:," you guys! it was bananas, cream, and beef! i i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldn't feel bad!"
6,9,monica:," well actually, i i didn't eat mine. it's still in the bathroom."
6,9,joey:, well we left ours in monica's bedroom.
6,9,joey:," nope, got it and i got yours too. "
6,10,chandler:," let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? i remember when people used to use big lights."
6,10,rachel:," that's a good story, grandpa. "
6,10,ross:, hey
6,10,all:, hey
6,10,ross:," wow, monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! did someone get her drunk again or?"
6,10,monica:, having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about. it's about being with the people that you love.
6,10,phoebe:, that is nice and we're done. tada! 
6,10,chandler:," i dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like christmas to me."
6,10,monica:," oh, here. "
6,10,chandler:, see now it feels like christmas! opening credits 
6,10,ross:," ' and that's the story of the dreidle. now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. and that was like 4000 years ago."
6,10,rachel:," so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story. "
6,10,joey:, hey you guys.
6,10,chandler:, hey joe what's up?
6,10,joey:," i had to get out of the apartment. janine is like stretching all over the place. y'know, everywhere i look she's like ' "
6,10,chandler:, i can see why that's hard to resist.
6,10,joey:, i like her so much!
6,10,monica:," aw, i'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way."
6,10,joey:, i know. and she's so sweet. i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
6,10,chandler:," you are aware that she's not a monkey, right?"
6,10,ross:," i am so over janine. i mean, yeah, at first i thought she was hot, but now she's like old news! "
6,10,janine:, hey guys!
6,10,ross:, hi janine!
6,10,janine:, i just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for new year's eve. it's called some sort of dick'n rock'n dickie eve.
6,10,monica:, hold it! are you talking about dick clark's new year's rocking eve?
6,10,janine:," yeah, that's what i said."
6,10,monica:, oh my god! we love that show! i mean ross and i have been watching it since i can remember!
6,10,chandler:," ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you? "
6,10,janine:, well i'm gonna be on it this year. i'm gonna be one of the party people.
6,10,ross:, you're gonna be a party person! those guys rock the most!
6,10,janine:, well they said i should bring someone. do you wanna be my dance partner?
6,10,joey:, totally! i would love to spend new year's with you.
6,10,janine:, well actually they're taping tomorrow. i don't really understand why.
6,10,ross:," oh, well you see how it works is, the part with dick clark in times square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. yeah, not a lot of people know that."
6,10,janine:," yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?"
6,10,ross:, are you serious?
6,10,monica:, we are there! 
6,10,chandler:," what, what are you laughing at?"
6,10,rachel:," well, i used to date him, but you're still going out with her! "
6,10,janine:, thanks. great so we can all go together! i gotta run. catch you later! 
6,10,all:, bye!
6,10,ross:, bye janine!
6,10,joey:, did she just ask me out on a date?
6,10,chandler:, i don't think so.
6,10,monica:, what are you talking about? she just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
6,10,rachel:," yeah, but she also invited you and ross. yeah, honey, i'm sorry, but i don't think that was a romantic thing."
6,10,joey:," oh. maybe. but hey i know how i can find out. we're going to a new year's eve party, right? so at midnight, i can kiss her. and if she kisses me back, great! y'know? but if she says ''dude, what the hell are you doing?' i can say ''it wasn't me, it was new years!'"
6,10,rachel:," well, that's a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick."
6,10,ross:, it was a dry day.
6,10,monica:, we are going to dick clark's new year's rocking eve!
6,10,ross:, oh my god!
6,10,monica:, oh my god!
6,10,chandler:, oh my god! 
6,10,joey:," ok, listen i've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? it's a show, but we're just dancing, ok? it's no big deal. the important thing to remember  stay cool."
6,10,ross:, got it! 
6,10,ross:, oh my god it's just like i dreamed it!
6,10,director:, ''scuse us
6,10,director:," here's what's gonna happen. the music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. any questions?"
6,10,ross:," yeah, i have a question. when is this gonna air? "
6,10,director:," uh, yeah. now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and i want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out."
6,10,joey:, ross! so when is it gonna air? 
6,10,rachel:," okay, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet."
6,10,chandler:," i can save you time ladies, i'm right here."
6,10,phoebe:," yeah, chandler why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern you."
6,10,rachel:, we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
6,10,chandler:, what? that's terrible!
6,10,phoebe:," no no, we do it every year!"
6,10,chandler:," oh well, that makes it not terrible."
6,10,phoebe:," no, yeah, we never find them! she's always best at us that wily minx."
6,10,rachel:," don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok?"
6,10,chandler:," no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents!"
6,10,phoebe:, but we have to!
6,10,chandler:," no, you don't have to, and you can't because i live here too."
6,10,phoebe:," well then, you should look with us."
6,10,chandler:, why?
6,10,rachel:," chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for christmas?"
6,10,chandler:," no, i have a great idea for a present for her."
6,10,phoebe:," oh, that's it? a great idea!"
6,10,rachel:," chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you've just gotten her one great present? i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?"
6,10,chandler:," if i help, we can find ''em faster!"
6,10,rachel:, that's right! 
6,10,phoebe:," ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
6,10,rachel:," oh, it's a macy's bag! "
6,10,phoebe:," ooh, who's it for?"
6,10,rachel:," dear losers, do you really think i'd hide presents under the couch? p.s. chandler, i knew they'd break you."
6,10,phoebe:, uh oh. she may be onto us.
6,10,rachel:, we are so gonna find them this year.
6,10,chandler:," y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?"
6,10,rachel:, yeah.
6,10,chandler:," no, we never do that "
6,10,chandler:," because that's where joey gave me some stuff to store that i've never seen before in my life! okay, that did not just happen! "
6,10,monica:," okay, here comes another camera."
6,10,ross:, right. no biggie. stay loose. 
6,10,ross:, why do they keep doing that?
6,10,monica:," if we wanna get on camera, i think we have to get up on one of those platforms. they've been taping those people up there all day."
6,10,ross:, right. 
6,10,ross:," hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?"
6,10,girl:, we learned how to dance.
6,10,monica:, oh yeah? well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
6,10,ross:, yeah! 
6,10,janine:, hey! you're a good dancer!
6,10,joey:, really?
6,10,janine:," yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little."
6,10,joey:, what do you mean?
6,10,janine:, like this. 
6,10,janine:," that's it, feel the rhythm. that's better."

6,10,joey:," god! what are you, in second grade?"
6,10,joey:," hey, now you're the one who wet his pants. "
6,10,monica:," man, this sucks! y'know if mom and dad don't see us on tv after we made them so jealous, i mean, who's gonna be the losers then?"

6,10,monica:, was it really that good?
6,10,ross:," we got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?"
6,10,monica:," okay, let's do it. mom and dad are gonna be so faced! "

6,10,monica:, yes! 
6,10,director:," hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner."
6,10,director:, what's going on over here?
6,10,joey:," uh, take a look at the guy's pants! i mean, i know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?"

6,10,ross:, can you believe this? we're gonna be on the platform for the millennium moment!

6,11,ross:, why did you do that?
6,11,rachel:, because she hates pottery barn.
6,11,ross:, she hates pottery barn?!!
6,11,rachel:," i know! i know, she says it's all mass produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. so come on, she's gonna be here any second! can we please just cover this up with something?! please?"

6,11,joey:," that's right! i helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. huh? i helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and i looked like an idiot! and i was humiliated. and i only made 200 dollars!"
6,11,monica:, we didn't give you any money! 
6,11,joey:, you don't think i know that! 
6,11,rachel:," 'see i can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the sahara desk, or the parker console table."
6,11,ross:, wow! i didn't know that there was a pottery barn up here.
6,11,rachel:," i know, i know. i went a little crazy."
6,11,ross:, a little? your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. oh look at that! the ornamental bird cage! large!
6,11,phoebe:, hey!
6,11,rachel:, hey.
6,11,phoebe:," oh ross no. be careful, that is very old! okay? early colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that."
6,11,ross:, fascinating.
6,11,phoebe:, another amazing find! wow! oh i bet this has a great story too!
6,11,rachel:," oh it does, it does! it is a room separating apparatus from colonial times."
6,11,phoebe:, ah!
6,11,ross:," hmm, a lot of this stuff is from colonial times. hey, what are some other time periods rachel? "
6,11,rachel:," well there's yore. and uh, y'know, yesteryear."
6,11,phoebe:," yeah no, i'm telling you rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorateand i think that you should. you should, you should ask rachel to help."
6,11,rachel:, oh honey he doesn't need my help.
6,11,phoebe:," oh, come on! i think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? the cheap knock offs and dinosaur junk."
6,11,ross:," really?! hey, y'know what? since you have such a great sense of what i need, uh ooh, here's here's 60 bucks, why don't you take phoebe down to that colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff."
6,11,rachel:," y'know what? i don't, i don't think phoebe really wants to come."
6,11,phoebe:, no! i do want to!
6,11,rachel:," oh, she does want to."
6,11,ross:, she does want to.
6,11,phoebe:, yeah! 
6,11,rachel:," pheebs, i don't know what to say. i guess the flea market was just better last time."
6,11,phoebe:, well at least i got these sheets for ross.

6,11,phoebe:," uck, look at this! pottery barn, yuck!"
6,11,rachel:," yeah, y'know what? don't look at it. seriously, don't look at it. "
6,11,phoebe:, no! look look! there's the coffee table they stole from us!
6,11,rachel:," ugh, those bastards! let's go."
6,11,phoebe:, that fan kinda looks like ours. and the birdcage and the 'wait a sec! this is our exact living room!
6,11,rachel:," no! no! no! no it's not! no it's not! come on! phoebe, ours is totally different! i mean we don't have the ' we don't have the 'that lamp! and and that screen is y'know, on the other side."
6,11,phoebe:," oh my god. this is where you got all our stuff, pottery barn! oh my god!"
6,11,rachel:," okay! okay okay lookno i did, i just wanted this stuff and i know how you feel about pottery barn. just ' come on don't be mad."
6,11,phoebe:," no no no, but i am mad! i am mad! because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! and it's all sitting up in my living room and all i can think about is how i don't have that lamp!"
6,11,rachel:," well then honey, buy the lamp! hey, we have that 60 bucks from ross."
6,11,phoebe:, i can't! i can't! unless ' well are you saying that that you would move out if if i didn't buy that lamp?
6,11,rachel:, what?! no! i'm not gonna move out!
6,11,phoebe:, but are you saying that you would move out if i didn't buy that lamp?
6,11,rachel:, oh. yes! i would so move out!
6,11,phoebe:, okay then i don't have a choice! i have to buy that lamp!
6,11,rachel:, that's right! 
6,11,phoebe:, but at least the apothecary table is real. 
6,11,joey:," well, this this this was great. didn't everybody have a great time?"
6,11,janine:," well i did. i really did. and you guys, i've got to say, i'm sorry if i was a little weird after the last time we went out. i guess i was just nervous or something."
6,11,chandler:, that's totally understandable.
6,11,monica:, don't worry about it.
6,11,janine:, so we can go out again?
6,11,chandler:, oh yeah!

6,11,monica:," i knew it!! y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!"
6,11,chandler:," and i'm blah? listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, ""oh chandler, i just lost myself in the moment."""
6,11,janine:," y'know, i know you're talking, but all i hear is, ""blah. blah. blah blah blah."""
6,11,monica:, all right! you and me! let's go! right now!

6,11,janine:," okay. okay. would, would it help if i went over and apologized?"
6,11,joey:, yeah! yeah! that would be very helpful! yeah. 
6,11,monica:, what did i tell you about the hall?!
6,11,janine:, i was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! i'd really like it if we could be friends.
6,11,monica:," well, i know that would make joey happy, so, i would like that too."

6,12,monica:," well, you tell a lot of jokes!"
6,12,ross:," look, chandler, it's my joke. but, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?"

6,12,phoebe:," oh, i want to look too! . yikes!"
6,12,monica:," so do you think that these picturesare, are they trying to tell a story?"
6,12,rachel:," oh, yeah, sure. i mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, ''where are they, where are they?'"
6,12,monica:," well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that. "
6,12,phoebe:, yeah.
6,12,rachel:," you see, now, i would date this girl. she's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, that's got to come in handy"
6,12,monica:," okay, i've got a question. if you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?"
6,12,rachel:, i don't know.
6,12,monica:, me neither.
6,12,phoebe:, rachel.
6,12,monica:, what?!
6,12,phoebe:, i don't know. me neither. 
6,12,joey:, you forget how many great songs heart had.
6,12,chandler:, yeah.
6,12,ross:," you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard."
6,12,chandler:," so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
6,12,joey:," oh, you guys, with this joke. i gotta say, i know i cracked up, but i'm not even sure i got it."
6,12,ross:," what, you didn't get it? the doctor is a monkey. "
6,12,chandler:, and monkeys can't write out prescriptions. 
6,12,chandler:, you are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
6,12,ross:," your joke? well, i think ''the hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah dollars."
6,12,chandler:," so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
6,12,ross:," well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think i'll show the sexy teller that i am a published writer."
6,12,chandler:," well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
6,12,ross:," oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"
6,12,chandler:, yeah!
6,12,ross:," well, i'm not going to go now anyway ."
6,12,chandler:, okay . 
6,12,gunther:, here you go.
6,12,joey:," ah, gunther, i can't pay for this right now because i'm not working, so i've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff."
6,12,gunther:," well, if you want, you can work here."
6,12,joey:," uh, i don't know. ya see, it's just, see i was a regular on a soap opera y'know? and to go from that to this, i just ' plus, i'd have to wait on all my friends."
6,12,gunther:," okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want."
6,12,joey:, what?!
6,12,gunther:, flexible hours.
6,12,joey:, maybe i could be a waiter. could i use the phone? 
6,12,monica:," she picked rachel. i mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. she picked rachel."
6,12,chandler:," he took my joke, he took it. "
6,12,monica:, it's wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel.
6,12,chandler:," you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what? i'm going to get a joke journal. y'know? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
6,12,monica:, that's a good idea. 
6,12,chandler:, yeah!
6,12,monica:, do you know what's a bad idea?
6,12,chandler:, picking rachel.
6,12,monica:, that's right. did you hear something?
6,12,chandler:, maybe it's the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
6,12,monica:, it's coming from the living room. 
6,12,joey:, i finished my book. 
6,12,monica:, hey.
6,12,monica:," oh, don't you guys look cute. you guys make such a cute couple."
6,12,rachel:," monica, what are you doing?"
6,12,monica:," nothing, i'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. remember, when you picked rachel over me? that was funny."
6,12,phoebe:, i guess it was kinda funny.
6,12,monica:, it wasn't funny at all! why would you do that? why didn't you pick me?
6,12,phoebe:, fine. the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that you're ' just ' kinda high maintenanceokay let's go to lunch!
6,12,monica:," that is completely untrue. you think i'm high maintenance? okay, prove it. i want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!"
6,12,phoebe:," no, okay, you're right. you're easy going. you're just not as easy going as rachel. she's just more flexible and and mellow. that's all."
6,12,rachel:," well, people are different."
6,12,phoebe:," ya, you know, rachel ' she'll do whatever you want. y'know, you can just walk all over her."
6,12,rachel:," what? wait a minute. what are you saying, that i'm a pushover? i'm not a pushover."
6,12,phoebe:," oh, okay, you're not a pushover."
6,12,rachel:," oh my ' you think i'm a pushover. well wait, watch this, you know what? you're not invited to lunch. what do you think of that? i think that's pretty strong, that's what i think. come on, monica, let's go to lunch. "
6,12,monica:, you start working on that list. 
6,12,rachel:, i cannot believe her.
6,12,monica:, i know. where do you wanna go eat?
6,12,rachel:," oh, oh, i love that japanese place."
6,12,monica:, i'm sick of japanese. we're not going there.
6,12,rachel:," all right, wherever you wanna go is cool."
6,12,monica:, all right. 
6,12,ross:," oh, hey, gunther, check this out. "
6,12,gunther:," yeah, that that chandler cracks me up. "
6,12,joey:," hey ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ''cause i'm heading up there."
6,12,ross:," uh, yeah, i'll take a coffee. thanks, man."
6,12,joey:, sure. coffee? ''cause i'm going up there. 
6,12,rachel:, no.
6,12,monica:," no, thank you."
6,12,joey:," you guys need anything, ''cause i'm heading up there. "
6,12,woman:, i'd love an ice water.
6,12,joey:, you got it.
6,12,monica:," joey, what are you doing?"
6,12,joey:, just being friendly. 
6,12,rachel:," joey, honey, i don't think you're supposed to go back there."
6,12,joey:," nah, it's okay. right, gunther? "
6,12,gunther:, don't wink at me. and put on your apron.
6,12,joey:," okay, but i don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons. "
6,12,monica:," joey, do you work here?"
6,12,joey:, no.
6,12,customer:," hey, waiter."
6,12,joey:, yeah? commercial break 
6,12,monica:," joey, what's going on. what didn't you tell us you work here?"
6,12,joey:," it's kind of embarrassing, y'know. i mean, i was an actor and now i'm a waiter. it's supposed to go in the other direction."
6,12,chandler:, so is your apron. you're wearing it like a cape.
6,12,joey:," i mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? i guess i'm going to be hanging out here anyway. i might as well get paid for it, right? i just feel kind of weird serving you guys."
6,12,rachel:," come on, joey, i did it and it was fine."
6,12,ross:," yeah, why would it be weird? hey, joey, can i get some coffee?"
6,12,joey:," okay, i guess it doesn't seem that weird."
6,12,ross:," seriously, i i asked you before and you still haven't gotten it."
6,12,joey:," see, now it's weird again."
6,12,chandler:," don't eat yellow snow. . ah ha ha, 2 , coffeehouse."
6,12,rachel:," well, you know what? this is great. finally, i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too. let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse. first of all, the customer is always right. a smile goes a long way. and if anyone is ever rude to you? sneeze muffin."
6,12,joey:," thanks, rach. look, you guys are just terrific. y'know? now, how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers. it's all about turnover."
6,12,ross:," joey, seriously, can i get my coffee?"
6,12,joey:," oh, i'm sorry, ross. i'll get it for you right now. and since i made you wait, i'll toss in a free muffin. "
6,12,rachel:, phoebe. we would like to talk to you for a second.
6,12,phoebe:, okay.
6,12,monica:," so, maybe i am a little high maintenance. and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover. but you know what we decided you are?"
6,12,rachel:," yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, phoebe, are flaky."
6,12,monica:, hah!
6,12,phoebe:," that true, i am flaky."
6,12,rachel:," so, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?"
6,12,phoebe:," yeah, totally."
6,12,monica:," well, then, i'm okay with being high maintenance."
6,12,rachel:," yeah, and i am okay with being a pushover."
6,12,phoebe:, that's great. good for you guys.
6,12,monica:, i am not high maintenance!
6,12,rachel:, i am not a pushover!
6,12,phoebe:, you did!
6,12,phoebe:," oh, i'm flaky. i'll say anything. "
6,12,joey:," hey, gunther. can you uh, can you cover for me? i just got an audition."
6,12,gunther:," no, i'm leaving to get my hair dyed."
6,12,joey:," really?! i like your natural color. come on man, it's a great part. look, check it out. i'm the lead guy's best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat. listen listen. ''i'm sorry, that seat's saved.'"
6,12,gunther:, that's the whole part?
6,12,joey:," okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but '"
6,12,gunther:," okay, i'll see you in an hour."
6,12,joey:," oh, man, i could totally get that part. ''i'm sorry, that seat is taken.'"
6,12,patron:," oh, excuse me."
6,12,joey:," no, no, i didn't mean you. but, you believed me, huh?"
6,12,patron:, i believed you were saving this seat for someone.
6,12,joey:," so, you'd hire me, right?"
6,12,patron:, for what?
6,12,joey:," exactly! all right, everybody, listen up. the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour. "
6,12,customers:, huh? what?
6,12,joey:," yeah, it's for the kids. to keep the kids off drugs. it's a very important issue in this month's playboy. i'm sure you all read about it. "
6,12,ross:, it's my joke.
6,12,chandler:, it's my joke.
6,12,ross:," y'know, i don't think we're going to settle this."
6,12,chandler:, let's have monica decide.
6,12,ross:, yeah!
6,12,chandler:, yeah!
6,12,ross:, hey mon.
6,12,chandler:," mon, get out here!"
6,12,ross:, monica! 
6,12,chandler:," okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is."
6,12,monica:, why do i have to decide?
6,12,chandler:, because you're the only one that can be fair.
6,12,ross:, yeah.
6,12,monica:, i can't be fair. you're my boyfriend.
6,12,ross:," yeah, but i'm your brother. we're family. that's the most important thing in the world."
6,12,chandler:," don't try to sway her. i'm your only chance to have a baby. okay, let's go."
6,12,ross:, we'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme. 
6,12,monica:," okay, chandler, you go first."
6,12,chandler:," okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve."
6,12,monica:," oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas?"
6,12,chandler:, can i finish my story?!
6,12,monica:, do you want me to pick you?!
6,12,ross:," see, i would never snap at you like that. "
6,12,monica:, continue.
6,12,chandler:," so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steve's doctor's name is doctor muppy. so i said, ''doctor monkey?' and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. "
6,12,ross:," are you kidding? okay, look. i i studied evolution. remember, evolution? monkey into man? plus, i'm a doctor, and i had a monkey. i'm doctor monkey!"
6,12,chandler:, i'm not arguing with that.
6,12,monica:," all right, i've heard enough. i've made my decision. "
6,12,monica:," you are both idiots. the joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! you shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! now let it go! the joke sucks! "
6,12,ross:, it's your joke.
6,12,chandler:, is not. 
6,12,monica:," hi, chandler. there you are."
6,12,chandler:," hi, oh hi."
6,12,monica:," hey, it's phoebe and rachel. um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance? "
6,12,chandler:," monica is a self sufficient, together lady. being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit."
6,12,rachel:," wow, you know what? that is the best fake speech i think i've ever heard."
6,12,phoebe:, really? i've heard better.
6,12,monica:," wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler."
6,12,chandler:, i'm out of words. should i just say the whole thing again?
6,12,monica:," look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler!"
6,12,chandler:, you're a little high maintenance.
6,12,monica:, ahhh! you are on my list.
6,12,chandler:," i'm sorry. you're not easy going, but you're passionate, and that's good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that i'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. and that's good too. so, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because i like ' maintaining you."
6,12,monica:, i didn't even tell him to say that. . all right you're off my list. 
6,12,chandler:, i'm off the list. 
6,12,monica:," phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend."
6,12,phoebe:," y'know, suddenly i find you very attractive. "
6,12,chandler:," hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?"
6,12,joey:," not good, no. i didn't get the part, and i lost my job here, so '"
6,12,phoebe:, wow! that is a bad audition.
6,12,rachel:, how how did you lose your job here?
6,12,joey:," well, i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. so, i went anyway, and then he fired me."
6,12,rachel:," he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? that's not, that's not right."
6,12,joey:," yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
6,12,rachel:," joey, you can't let him get away with that. ya know what, i'm not going to let him get away with that. i'm going to say something to himno, i really shouldn't say anythingno, i should say something to him. gunther, i want you to give joey his job back. that is really not fair that you have to fire him '"
6,12,gunther:, okay.
6,12,rachel:, what?
6,12,gunther:, he can have his job back.
6,12,rachel:," that's right, he can have his job back. i'm glad we got that all straightened out. there you go, joey, you got your job back."
6,12,joey:, that's great. thanks rach.
6,12,rachel:," yeah, pretty nice, huh? now who's a pushover?"
6,12,phoebe:," rach, you're in my seat."
6,12,rachel:," oh, i'm sorry. ending credits "
6,12,phoebe:," hey, i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend."
6,12,monica:," i pick you, phoebe."
6,12,rachel:," oh, yeah. definitely you, pheebs."
6,12,phoebe:," yeah, well, i kinda thought. "
6,12,chandler:, hey.
6,12,rachel:," hey. oh, i have a question. if if if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?"
6,12,ross:, no way. 
6,12,joey:, i'm not answering that.
6,12,chandler:, joey! no way. i'm not answering that. 
6,13,joey:," okay rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. ross, double latte, $2.75. chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. and pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. so, all together that's $12.75."
6,13,chandler:, this coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half. 
6,13,woman:, hi!
6,13,joey:, hi!
6,13,woman:, how much do i owe you for the muffin and the latte?
6,13,joey:, oh that's on the house courtesy of joey tribbiani.
6,13,woman:," oh great! well, tell him thanks. and since uh, joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?"
6,13,joey:," well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, i good check with himhe says it's okay. great! thanks! bye bye!"
6,13,ross:," hey joey, how come our stuff isn't free?"
6,13,joey:, it will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! this is great! i'm getting more dates than ever!
6,13,rachel:," wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?"
6,13,phoebe:, yeah joey that is so gross!
6,13,joey:, how about a scone on the house baby?
6,13,phoebe:, i'm pretty. opening credits 
6,13,ross:, hey does anyone have any gum?

6,13,all:, ohh!
6,13,chandler:, i'm so sorry you're sick.
6,13,monica:, i'm not sick!! i don't get sick! getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies! 
6,13,rachel:," honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. "
6,13,monica:, i have not been sick in over three years! 
6,13,chandler:, i'm gonna grab you some tissue.
6,13,monica:, i don't need a tissue! i'm fine d! 
6,13,ross:, when you put a ''d' at the end of ''fine' you're not fine.
6,13,monica:," i'm fine d. i'm fine d! y'know, it's a really hard word to say. "
6,13,chandler:, yes?

6,14,rachel:, i'm not telling you what to do! i am telling you what not to do!
6,14,jill:, why are you so jealous of me?
6,14,rachel:, jill this is not about me being jealous of you! this is about you being a brat! wanting what you can't have!
6,14,jill:," can't have?! excuse me, the only thing i can't have is dairy! "
6,14,rachel:," all right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating bob!"

6,14,ross:," and and i, and i saw that joey was about to go in, so i ran in ahead of him to to surprise him and, and then i pretended i didn't know he was in there. "
6,14,rachel:," wow! i mean, i justi can't, i can't believe this. y'know, i mean you think you know someone even, even phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark."
6,14,monica:," this is so bizarre. i guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood."
6,14,chandler:," hey, i had a terrible childhood and i don't do porn."
6,14,monica:," yes, but you are dead inside."
6,14,joey:," all right well, i'd better take that back."

6,14,monica:, why are you reading this? you hate this kind of stuff.
6,14,chandler:," yeah i know, but i figured a shot y'know? maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think i was y'know, all dead inside."
6,14,monica:," oh that's so sweet! look chandler i don't care if you can't cry, i love you."
6,14,chandler:, oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
6,14,monica:, stop it!

6,14,monica:," i won't care, because i know you will be feeling it all in here. "
6,14,chandler:, yeah?
6,14,monica:," yeah! and if, and if we have a baby one day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! and and and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me."
6,14,chandler:," okay, well i won't uh, worry about this anymore then."
6,14,monica:," and and and if i die, from a long illness. and you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""i will always be with you,"" and you still can't shed one tiny tear, i know you'll be crying a river inside."
6,14,chandler:," aww, i love you so '"
6,14,monica:, what is wrong with you?!!!
6,14,chandler:, what?!
6,14,monica:," what?! you can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! now, i left you a note from the beyond!"

6,14,jill:," rachel and i had a really big fight, can i come in? i i mean i know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and i'm okay with that, it's just that i don't know anybody in the city and i really need somebody to talk to about it."
6,14,ross:," of course, what happened? "
6,14,jill:, i don't want to talk about it.
6,14,ross:," okay, umm '"

6,14,ross:," well, i'd love to! here, you wait right here and i'll go get the projector and my notes!"
6,14,jill:," oh great! thanks ross, you're such a good friend!"
6,14,ross:," ohh! (he goes into another room to get his projector and notes. while he's gone, jill quickly checks her makeup. "
6,14,rachel:, hey! have you guys seen jill? i can't find her anywhere.
6,14,monica:," no, i haven't."
6,14,rachel:," well, is ross home? maybe i'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her. "

6,14,ross:," o okay, rach calm calm down, okay? she she's really upset we're just talking."
6,14,rachel:, ross! i think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
6,14,ross:, so that's the only reason she could be here huh? it couldn't have anything to do with the fact that that maybe i'm a good listener and i uh i put on a great slide show!
6,14,rachel:," ross, i am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
6,14,ross:," y'know what? i think i can take care of myself, i'll talk to you later. good bye. whoa! uh, that was your sister actually. she she thinks that you're just using me."
6,14,jill:, so?

6,14,joey:, nice!
6,14,phoebe:," um mmm, and i won't have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address."
6,14,joey:," that's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?"
6,14,phoebe:, oh no! no! i know how to handle it.
6,14,joey:, you do?
6,14,phoebe:," yeah. you're trying to figure out where you know me from? all right, i'll give you a hint. from porn! okay? yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! see?"

6,14,ross:," umm, she kissed me."
6,14,rachel:, what?! you kissed!
6,14,chandler:, maybe we should give them some privacy.
6,14,monica:, shhhh!!!
6,14,ross:," look, i uh, i tried not to kiss her, okay?"
6,14,rachel:," well, it doesn't sound like it! i mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! see look at us, right now, not kissing!"
6,14,ross:," let me finish, okay? she started kissing me and and i didn't stop it. i guess i i just wasn't thinking '"
6,14,rachel:, yeah that's right you weren't thinking! y'know what? let me give you something to think about! 
6,14,ross:, oh waithold it! but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing.
6,14,rachel:," oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that."
6,14,ross:, look i i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
6,14,rachel:, what?!
6,14,ross:," no, i mean, look i don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. ever. but i don't want to know that it it never could. so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector."
6,14,rachel:," wow. i, i don't even know what to say. thank you. "
6,14,ross:, you're welcome. 
6,14,monica:, oh my god! are are you crying?
6,14,chandler:, i just don't see why those two can't work things out! ending credits

6,14,rachel:," yeah, i got that."

6,14,chandler:," i i can't believe jill's gone. i can't help it, i opened a gate."
6,15,rachel:," hey, you guys! guess what? barry and mindy are getting a divorce!"
6,15,monica:, oh my god!
6,15,phoebe:, wow!
6,15,joey:, what is the matter with you?!
6,15,phoebe:, no! barry and mindy.
6,15,joey:," oh sorry, i hear divorce i immediately go to ross. who who's barry and mindy?"
6,15,rachel:, barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend.
6,15,joey:," ohh oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?"
6,15,rachel:," yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me."
6,15,monica:, why did they get divorced?
6,15,rachel:," well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. isn't that sad? god, could you imagine if i actually married him?! i mean how different would my life be?"
6,15,ross:," i know what you mean, i've always wondered how different my life would be if if i'd never gotten divorced."
6,15,phoebe:, which time?
6,15,ross:," the first time! no seriously, imagine if carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian."
6,15,joey:, i can't. i keep seeing it the good way.
6,15,ross:," i'd bet i'd still be doing my kara tay. towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical."
6,15,chandler:, maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara tay.
6,15,monica:," and what if i was still fat? well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure."
6,15,chandler:, sure i would!
6,15,all:, oh yeah! come on! yeah right!
6,15,chandler:," what, you guys really think that i'm that shallow?"
6,15,ross:," no, i just think monica was that fat."
6,15,joey:," hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives! oh hey, there's carol again!"
6,15,chandler:," what if i had had the guts to quit my job? i'd probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my job's fun too! i mean tomorrow, i i don't have to wear a tie."
6,15,phoebe:, what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch?
6,15,ross:, what?!
6,15,rachel:, merrill lynch?
6,15,phoebe:," yeah, i had a massage client who worked there and and he said i had a knack for stocks."
6,15,rachel:, well why didn't you take the job?
6,15,phoebe:," because at that time you see, i thought everything that rhymed was true. so i thought y'know that if i'd work with stocks, i'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox."
6,15,ross:," this is where the opening credits are, but they're not the usual opening credits. oh no! these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. it then goes on to show rachel's still a shop aholic and with barry. fat monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. phoebe as the wall street shark smoking while on two cell phones. then they're dancing in the fountain. joey entering as dr. drake remoray and meeting a groupie. chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. ross doing some kara tay and trying to get carol into bed. and finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. everything from every other episode doesn't apply, for instance, ross and rachel have no history. and in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.} "
6,15,ross:, oh my god! rachel green?
6,15,rachel:, rob tillman!
6,15,ross:," no no. it's it's me, ross!"
6,15,rachel:," oh, i'm sorry. ross tillman."
6,15,ross:," no, no no, ross geller."
6,15,rachel:," ohh, of course monica's brother!"
6,15,ross:, yeah. right.
6,15,rachel:, wow! how are you?!
6,15,ross:," good good, i'm i'm married. "
6,15,rachel:, ohh! me too!
6,15,ross:, is isn't it the best?
6,15,rachel:," oh, it's the best! so, umm how's monica?"
6,15,ross:," oh really, really great! yeah! a actually she's right down the street, umm, do do you know what? you should stop bye and say hi."
6,15,rachel:," ohh, i would love too."
6,15,ross:," yeah? oh oh, she'd be so excited!"
6,15,rachel:, ohh! okay!
6,15,ross:, come on! 
6,15,rachel:," oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, busty ladies?"
6,15,ross:," no, it's okay. some some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but i don't '"
6,15,rachel:, oh yeah? okay.
6,15,ross:, okay.
6,15,rachel:, but! don't you have to give him his money back?
6,15,ross:," uh huh. hey, here you go buddy. sorry, no porn for you. okay, let's go see monica! "
6,15,joey:," so monica, still going out with dr. boring huh?"
6,15,monica:," here we go, one hazelnut latte. "
6,15,monica:," yeah. y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed."
6,15,joey:, can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
6,15,joey:," oh dear god, let me think. "
6,15,chandler:, hey.
6,15,joey:, hey.
6,15,monica:, oh no! what's the matter?
6,15,chandler:, y'know what honey? i got to get back to the hospital.
6,15,monica:, okay.
6,15,monica:," bye bye. oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the brazil nut. "
6,15,chandler:, was his question what's more boring than him?
6,15,joey:," hey man, look sorry about that archie thing. do uh, do you need me to give you some money?"
6,15,chandler:," hey, i may have no money, but i still have my pride."
6,15,joey:, really?
6,15,chandler:, ehh.
6,15,monica:," maybe joey doesn't have to give you the money, tv stars have assistants right?"
6,15,joey:," that's an idea! hey, if i hired an assistant, would would you take money from her?"
6,15,monica:," no joey! chandler could be your assistant! see, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!"
6,15,joey:, that's great! that would be great! let's do that!
6,15,chandler:, i could use the money; it could give me time to write.
6,15,joey:, oh right great! welcome aboard!
6,15,chandler:, okay!
6,15,joey:," all right! now hey, i need to use the bathroom. since i don't need any assistance in there, take a break!"

6,15,monica:, chandler!
6,15,chandler:," i know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because i make too many jokes and i've never been in a serious relationship and i guess i'm not technically a ""doctor '"" "

6,17,phoebe:, you mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? 
6,17,ross:," all i'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, i don't know, like a surprise!! "
6,17,ross:," all right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi. "

6,21,rachel:, wow! i definitely did not see that one backfiring! i'm gonna go to the bathroom.
6,21,ross:," yeah, take your time. "
6,21,ross:, just just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior. so it wasn't as bad as as '
6,21,paul:," ross, look, i know i've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because i'm very protective of lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad."
6,21,ross:, not all bad.
6,21,paul:," and anyhow, i'm sorry i was so harsh before, but you have to understand that i still look at lizzie like she's a twelve year old girl."
6,21,ross:, yeah. you know what? i know what you mean; i do that too.
6,21,paul:, i beg your pardon?
6,21,ross:," no! no! noti don't mean i i see her as a twelve year old girl! i mean i i have a son, who's umm six and i still think of him as a baby."

6,21,rachel:," i mean if you think about it, i mean ross did learn something from each marriage."
6,21,paul:, how to make the next one even shorter?
6,21,rachel:," now wait a minute that's not fair. he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily, he just didn't tell me. maybe i have to pee again. "
6,21,paul:," well, this is fun. so ross, did you kill any of these wives?"
6,21,ross:," y'know what? i i i ' i i have had enough of this! y'know, i i i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect! so if if you've got a problem with me, frankly '"

6,21,paul:, wow. what can i say? this doesn't make me like you any better!
6,21,ross:," that's okay, i'm not so crazy about myself right now either."

6,22,joey:, me too.
6,22,phoebe:, okay that's so generous!

6,22,phoebe:, great.
6,22,phoebe:, yeah.
6,22,rachel:, so what what is the exhibit.
6,22,phoebe:, it's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
6,22,joey:, oh man! 
6,22,ross:, hey!
6,22,rachel:, hi!
6,22,chandler:, hey!

6,22,monica:, i mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
6,22,ross:, why? what?
6,22,monica:," well, her father pays you for baby sitting right?"
6,22,ross:," no, no, that's funny. but maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? stop it! besides, rachel is going out with elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. looks like i'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?"
6,22,rachel:, i mean ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
6,22,ross:," okay, okay. uh, well uh, rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. "
6,22,chandler:, ross.
6,22,ross:," oh, come on you guys; that's funny! y'know? because he's needhe's got like a hearing aide y'know, ''cause ''cause y'know, ''cause he's all old, and ' "
6,22,paul:," okay look, ross, just so you know that since lizzie likes you so much, i've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her."
6,22,ross:," really? that okay, that's great."
6,22,paul:," yeah. but then i changed my mind. i'm funny like that. so i told lizzie, now i'm telling you, i don't want you seeing my daughter anymore."
6,22,ross:," all right look, i i realize it upsets you."
6,22,paul:, yes it does.
6,22,ross:," but, elizabeth and i are are both adults and so i don't think there's really anything you can do about it."
6,22,paul:, i'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
6,22,ross:, ohh! a man with a plan! opening credits 
6,22,phoebe:," oh, this is so exciting! you get your picture back up on the wall of fame! eek!"

"
6,22,rachel:," yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! i mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it."

6,23,phoebe:, that's easy! you just have to think of him as a as a jar of pickles that won't open.
6,23,rachel:, so what are you saying; i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?

6,23,ross:," well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. i i wish he would just tell me the truth."

6,23,paul:, no. what ever happened to that little dude. so full of dreams '
6,23,rachel:," i don't care about the little dude! i can't! i cannot listen to anymore of this! y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! and then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! do you know how much money i could've made listening to you? $2,000! and do you know when i figured that out? while you were talking!"
6,23,paul:, what?! i can't believe you're trying to stifle me! when just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
6,23,rachel:, oh ' i'm sorry. i ' i i don't meani didn't mean to stifle you. i ' this is all just a little overwhelming.
6,23,paul:," oh rachel, i'm so sorry. i didn't mean to overwhelm you. it's just that, when those gates open, you ' hard to close ''em. but they are closed now. believe me."
6,23,rachel:," i'm so glad, i'm so glad you shared. and i'm glad that you're done. what do you say we umm ' "
6,23,paul:, i would really like that. 
6,23,paul:, that was 'so good. 
6,23,phoebe:, hey.
6,23,chandler:, i can't believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
6,23,phoebe:, it's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! it's a beautiful ring!
6,23,chandler:," no, it's not! when i looked at the other ring i could see monica's face when i gave it to her, y'know? and i could see her saying yes. when i look at this ring, all i see is a ring! unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye. look, this is the most important thing i'm gonna do in my life. i wanna make sure it's perfect."
6,23,phoebe:, okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ''cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
6,23,chandler:, i can't do that.
6,23,phoebe:, well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring. 
6,23,phoebe:, there he is! 
6,23,chandler:, okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
6,23,phoebe:," wow! you're good! after this, we should solve crimes."
6,23,chandler:," yeah! okay, go, go, go get him."
6,23,phoebe:," oh, okay. excuse me sir? could you come with me please? you have a phone call."

6,23,customer:, oh john! great! 
6,23,phoebe:, here he is.
6,23,chandler:," hi! hi. okay, there was a slight mix up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. so, i'm gonna need to have that back. but, in exchange i'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. ew."
6,23,phoebe:, wow! i would trade.
6,23,customer:," it is beautiful, but i'm gonna use this one. now, if you'll excuse me."
6,23,chandler:, no no! this is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. you don't want to break her heart now do you?
6,23,phoebe:," yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?"
6,23,customer:, you're dying?! 
6,23,chandler:," yeah, she's dying ' of a cough apparently."
6,23,phoebe:," yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. see, if i'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity '"

6,24,rachel:, okay.
6,24,joey:," look, i don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! y'know? they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine!"
6,24,rachel:, not great. 
6,24,monica:," and so, we're hiding in the bathroom."
6,24,richard:, and and then i sneak out and before monica can her parents come in.

6,24,lisa:," for further reading on the above story, please check out the one where joey moves out.}"
6,24,chandler:," i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy. "
6,24,richard:," it's so great seeing you guys again. i'd like to make a toast. uh, as a poet once said, ""in the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."""
6,24,monica:, ohh.
6,24,chandler:, what?! 
6,24,ross:," oh my god, you guys!! "

6,24,monica:," oh ross, sometimes grown ups have commitments they just can't get out of!"
6,24,ross:," y'know, maybe she is too young for me. y'know, when i was over there and she was running around with her friends, i felt like i was a baby sitter. i finally started to see what you guys were talking about. i don't know what to do."
6,24,monica:, why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. i mean that's what i did when i first weighing stuff.
6,24,ross:," okay umm, bad stuff. well, i'm i'm 12 years older than she is."
6,24,monica:, if the school finds out you're fired.
6,24,ross:, hmm.
6,24,monica:, she's leaving for three months.
6,24,chandler:, for camp!
6,24,ross:," okay, good stuff. umm, well she's she's sweet and pretty and '"
6,24,monica:," look ross, the only question you need to ask is, ""do you see a future?"" i mean like do you see yourself marrying her? oh my god! you did it already! you married her, didn't you?!"
6,24,ross:," no! no! i 'didn't do that. it's just ' okay, honestly no. i don't, i don't see a big future with her."
6,24,monica:, okay well i think 'that's your answer.
6,24,ross:," i've got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part."
6,24,chandler:," hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year! "
6,24,joey:," rach! rachel! okay, the next highest bidder is at table one."
6,24,rachel:, oh great!
6,24,joey:, oh and uh the guy who got the paris trip is at table four.

6,24,phoebe:," well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor '"
6,24,joey:, glove salesman!
6,24,phoebe:, good one! yeah.
6,24,chandler:, this is terrible. what am i going to do?
6,24,phoebe:," look, she only suspects something okay? she doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track."
6,24,chandler:," that's right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind."
6,24,phoebe:, yeah! yeah! convince her that that you're scared of commitment! convince her that you're a little coward!
6,24,chandler:," i can do that, i've had 30 years of practice."
6,24,joey:," hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! "
6,24,monica:, i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!

6,24,chandler:," oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
6,24,joey:," yeah, big brother."
6,24,monica:, well that's a little crazy. although i am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the internet.
6,24,chandler:," yeah, well ' y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
6,24,monica:, why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world!
6,24,chandler:, eh '
6,24,monica:, okay well that's good to know. 
6,24,joey:, the mr. bowmont's here!!!

6,24,monica:, what uhwhat did youwhat?!
6,24,richard:," i still love you. and i know i probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, i mean you're with chandler a guy i really like, and if you say he's straight i'll believe you! after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didn't tell ya i'd regret it for the rest of my life. letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did."
6,24,monica:, y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
6,24,richard:," well yeah, i'm sorry. i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya! i wanna spend my life with you. i wanna marry you. i wanna have kids with you."

6,24,monica:," ohhh! what are you doing to me?! oh look, i i ' i'm sorry but umm, this this this this is not going to happen."
6,24,richard:," okay that's fine, i'll walk away. and i'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me chandler's willing to give you everything i am."
6,24,monica:," well he is! yeah, i mean marriage is all he talks about! my goodness, in fact, i'm the one that's making him wait!"
6,24,richard:, you are?
6,24,monica:, yeah!
6,24,richard:, why?
6,24,monica:, why? because of the government. 
6,24,rachel:," isn't it incredible?! monica and chandler, gettin' married."
6,24,phoebe:," i know, they're gonna be so happy together."
6,24,rachel:," ohh ' i mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?"
6,24,phoebe:, not that often!
6,24,rachel:, no! i'm so happy for them!
6,24,phoebe:, me too! so happy for them!
6,24,rachel:, i'm so happy and not at all jealous.
6,24,phoebe:," oh no! no god, definitely not jealous! "
6,24,rachel:," i mean i'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. and i mean what's 2%? that's nothing."
6,24,phoebe:, totally. i'm like 90/10.
6,24,rachel:, yeah me too. 
6,24,joey:," hey uh, have you guys scene chandler?"
6,24,rachel:," whno, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, tennille. "
6,24,monica:," so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?"
6,24,chandler:," sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. let's take a second here and look at pigs. okay pigs don't mate for life. i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!"
6,24,monica:," yeah, but that's pigs not people!"
6,24,chandler:," if marriage worked, i'd be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%."
6,24,monica:, wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that that you may never want to get married?
6,24,chandler:," well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never."
6,24,monica:, oh my god! then then then what are we even doing?! what is this?!
6,24,chandler:, whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? why don't you put down your copy of ''the rules' huh mantrap?!
6,24,monica:, y'know what?! i gotta go! ugh! 
6,24,chandler:," it's okay, i got a plan. "
6,24,rachel:, we're gonna find love!
6,24,phoebe:, definitely!
6,24,rachel:," yeah, i'm pretty confident about that. that's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler! it would be nice to have a little guarantee though."
6,24,phoebe:, what do you mean?
6,24,rachel:," well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other."
6,24,phoebe:, you mean a backup?
6,24,rachel:, exactly!
6,24,phoebe:," yeah, yeah i got that."
6,24,rachel:, you do?
6,24,phoebe:, hm mmm.
6,24,rachel:, who?
6,24,phoebe:, joey.
6,24,rachel:, joey?!
6,24,phoebe:, yeah!
6,24,rachel:, are you serious?!
6,24,phoebe:," yeah, i locked him years ago!"
6,24,rachel:," wh ' so ' if neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry joey."
6,24,phoebe:," yep, we shook on it. yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal."
6,24,rachel:," oh, seriously?"
6,24,phoebe:," ohh, yeah. i think his exact words were ' "
6,24,rachel:, charming.
6,24,phoebe:," well hey, it's just a backup."
6,24,rachel:, yeah. 
6,24,joey:, hey monica!
6,24,monica:, have you seen rachel? or a mirror?
6,24,joey:," this is for my boat, pretty cool huh?"
6,24,monica:," yeah, it's great."
6,24,joey:," whoa whoa, what's the matter?! talk to the captain!"
6,24,monica:, i'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead end relationship!
6,24,joey:, chandler giving you a hard time huh?
6,24,monica:," it's not like i want to get married tomorrow! it's just that i i'd like to believe that i'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that i'm not just wasting my time!"
6,24,joey:," well, you know chandler."
6,24,monica:, no i don't know chandler! not anymore! it's like it's like something's changed.
6,24,joey:, maybe you changed?
6,24,monica:, i didn't change!
6,24,joey:, maybe that's the problem.
6,24,monica:, what?!
6,24,joey:," chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife."
6,24,monica:, is that some kind of boat talk?
6,24,joey:, i don't know! i haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
6,24,monica:, what does he think? does he think i'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
6,24,joey:," monica face it, chandler is against marriage. and and always will be!"
6,24,monica:, well there's some people who do want to marry me.
6,24,joey:, there are?
6,24,monica:, yeah! richard!
6,24,joey:, r r richard said he wants to marry you?! and and chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
6,24,monica:, that's right.
6,24,joey:, chandler loves marriage!!
6,24,monica:, you just told me that he hates marriage! that that he's a a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! that that he's against marriage and always will be!
6,24,joey:, you got that from what i said?! 
6,24,narrator:," when the cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone."
6,24,ross:, what happened you guys? 
6,24,ross:, rach!
6,24,rachel:, hey you!
6,24,ross:," hey, come on in."
6,24,rachel:," oh thank you. hey y'know, i'm so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth."
6,24,ross:," oh, thanks. yeah, i really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, i guess it just wasn't meant to be."
6,24,rachel:," yeah, love. it's a tricky business isn't it?"
6,24,ross:, i guess so.
6,24,rachel:," so what do you say we make a pact? if you and i are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. i mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! you know what i mean? no like, ""what's that?!"""
6,24,ross:, right. ohh! you you want me to be your backup.
6,24,rachel:, exactly.
6,24,ross:," ohh, yeah i already have one."
6,24,rachel:, what? who?
6,24,ross:, phoebe.
6,24,rachel:," phoebe?! wait abut but she just, she said that joey was her backup."
6,24,ross:," ohh, i don't think so."
6,24,rachel:," ross! i just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and joey made a deal!"
6,24,ross:," that's impossible! i mean we have had a deal for years! we we we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that. "
6,24,joey:, where the hell have you been?!
6,24,chandler:, i was making a coconut phone with the professor.
6,24,joey:, richard told monica he wants to marry her!
6,24,chandler:, what?!
6,24,joey:," yeah! yeah, i've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!"
6,24,chandler:, myoh my god!
6,24,joey:, i know! they suck!!
6,24,chandler:, he's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! i'm supposed to do that!

6,24,monica:, no.
6,24,richard:, ahh.
6,24,monica:, but getting over was the hardest thing that i've ever had to do. and i never let myself think about you. 
6,24,rachel:, phoebe! you picked joey and ross?! you can not have two backups!
6,24,phoebe:," of course i can! it's just good sense to backup your backup! look, i've already lost chandler!"
6,24,rachel:, what?!
6,24,joey:, hey!
6,24,ross:, hey!
6,24,joey:, phoebe! we're both your backup?!
6,24,ross:," phoebe, how could you do this to me?!"

6,24,joey:, no we weren't!
6,24,ross:, i was not!
6,24,phoebe:," okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!"
6,24,rachel:, phoebe you can't have both of them! you have to pick one!
6,24,joey:, pick me!!
6,24,ross:, no! pick me! i don't want to end up an old maid!
6,24,phoebe:," all right well let's see, ross is a good father, but joey has a boatthis is hard!"
6,24,joey:," this is crazy! hey look, i wanna switch to rachel!"
6,24,ross:," ooh, i wanna switch to rachel too! "
6,24,phoebe:," no wait! justokayjust wait! you guys! wait you guys! don't make any rash decisions, okay? just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week."

6,24,richard:, i think that's fair.
6,24,monica:," fair? please don't even talk to me about fair! fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! or fair would've been chandler wanting to marry me now! believe me, nothing about this is fair! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing!"

6,24,chandler:," but i am willing to offer her all those things. this was just a plan, y'know? a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!"

6,24,chandler:," it was working until you showed up, you big tree! i mean, this isn't fair. you had your chance with her! you had your chance and you blew it! and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! and this is all just been one stupid mistake! i was gonna propose tonight."

7,1,chandler:," now monica, i know you're upset, but don't forget. there is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in paris."
7,1,monica:, paris?
7,1,chandler:, we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la .
7,1,monica:, keep talking.
7,1,chandler:," then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not just because it's romantic, but because i can!"
7,1,monica:, i love you! 
7,1,monica:," bonjour, monsieur."
7,1,chandler:," okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away. "

7,1,monica:," hi pheebs, what's up? "
7,1,phoebe:," okay, you said i could sing at your wedding so, i'm just gonna need a small deposit."
7,1,monica:, what?!
7,1,phoebe:," y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date."
7,1,chandler:," pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
7,1,phoebe:," oh, i see. [cut to the living room, joey is eating a sandwich.)"
7,1,joey:," they break your heart, don't they?"
7,1,phoebe:," y'know, i don't really their permission."
7,1,joey:," yeah! if you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
7,1,phoebe:," yeah! and if you wanna look 19, then you ' you gotta do something about your eyes."
7,1,joey:, what?! what's wrong with my eyes.
7,1,phoebe:, they give you away! there's just there's just too much wisdom in there. just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
7,1,joey:, and that'll get rid of my wisdom?
7,1,phoebe:, maybe just 10 minutes for you. 
7,1,chandler:," oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i don't care! "
7,1,monica:, yes.
7,1,rachel:," monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?"
7,1,chandler:," what a great apology! and you accept! okay, bye bye!"
7,1,rachel:," no no, seriously seriously, what was the especially me part about?"
7,1,monica:," well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder."
7,1,rachel:, what?!
7,1,ross:," hey, here's a thought. "
7,1,rachel:," monica, what are you talking about?"
7,1,monica:," my sweet sixteen! remember, you went to third base with my cousin charlie."
7,1,chandler:," ahh, third base."
7,1,monica:, it's all everybody at the party could talk about!
7,1,rachel:," monica, y'know what? the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring!"
7,1,monica:, we had a characturist!
7,1,rachel:, oh!! 
7,1,phoebe:," ""whenever i get married, guess who won't get to sing? somebody named geller! and somebody else named bing!"" "
7,1,rachel:," monica, your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago."
7,1,monica:," and yet, here we are doing it again."
7,1,rachel:," ugh, monica i don't want to steal your stupid thunder!"
7,1,monica:, oh please! why else would you have made out with ross?!
7,1,ross:, got me. 
7,1,rachel:," all right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!"
7,1,monica:, i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night!
7,1,rachel:," i swear, i never wanted any part of your night!"
7,1,monica:," oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!"

7,1,chandler:, why to save your dignity my man.
7,1,rachel:," monica, why? why would i ever want to take away from your night?"
7,1,monica:," i don't know! i don'tmaybe you're feeling a little resentful. maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!"
7,1,rachel:," oh wow. thaty'know what? that is so unfair. y'know what? now i want to steal your thunder! come on ross, let's go have sex! "

7,1,monica:, okay! why?!
7,1,rachel:, because! because i was sad.
7,1,monica:, what do you mean?
7,1,rachel:," look, i am so 'so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that i'm not. i'm not even close. and i don't know, maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better. and i know that that's dumb, but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler! "
7,1,chandler:," i don't care, she slept with me."

7,2,rachel:," hey hey, y'know what? i don't care! i'm not ashamed of my book. there's nothing with a woman enjoying a little 'erotica. it's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. "
7,2,joey:, you got porn! 
7,2,ross:, hello.
7,2,woman:," hi, is uh phoebe here?"
7,2,ross:," uh no no, she she's out for the night."

7,2,monica:, you don't know how that happened?! your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
7,2,chandler:, what a sweet story.
7,2,monica:, what?! they wanted a scary story!
7,2,monica:," you tell her jack, i can't do it."
7,2,monica:," we have it. only now, we call it the beach house. commercial break "
7,2,monica:," we're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself."
7,2,monica:," we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen."
7,2,monica:, well it was chandler! we didn't think he'd ever propose!
7,2,chandler:, clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. 
7,2,monica:," all right, enough! i don't want to hear about it anymore! good luck, chandler. "
7,2,ross:," okay! now, i'm going to touch you. ohh, that's soft. "
7,2,monica:, i can't believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
7,2,chandler:," i don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. she's saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to dollywood."
7,2,rachel:, well what happened at dinner?
7,2,monica:, my parents spent the money for our wedding!
7,2,phoebe:, my god! what did you order?!

7,2,monica:, no! no it's not! it's not gonna be okay! it sucks! no swing band! no lilies!
7,2,rachel:," no, y'know what? it's gonna be okay. i mean you don't have to have this rustic italian feast. y'know? and and you don't need, you don't need this custom made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. "
7,2,chandler:," look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married."
7,2,rachel:, do you even understand what off the rack means?!
7,2,phoebe:," look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?"
7,2,monica:, how? i don't have any money.
7,2,chandler:," well, i have some."
7,2,monica:, how much?
7,2,chandler:," well, close to ' "

7,2,rachel:," ohh, you guys are so made for each other."
7,2,chandler:," ah, yeah!"
7,2,chandler:," well, come on, i've been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
7,2,phoebe:," wow! hello, mr. chandler."
7,2,monica:, this is the most special day of our lives.
7,2,chandler:," no, i realize that honey, but i'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party."
7,2,monica:," honey, umm i i love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. okay? listen, we could always earn more money, okay? but uh, we're only gonna get married once."
7,2,chandler:," look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no."
7,2,monica:, you you're gonna have to put your foot down?
7,2,chandler:," yes, i am!"
7,2,phoebe:," wow, money and a firm hand. finally a chandler i can get on board with. "

7,2,ross:," damn, this coffee's cold! hey rach, do you mind if i heat this up on your loins? "

7,2,ross:, excuse me ladies. i'm sorry?
7,2,phoebe:," my massage client, arthur? his daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon."
7,2,ross:, i gave him an extremely professional massage!
7,2,phoebe:, he said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
7,2,ross:," okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. but i did give him accu pressure with a pair of chopsticks. and, and i gently exfoliated him with, with a mop."
7,2,phoebe:," well, he's never coming back! okay? you just cost me eight dollars a week!"
7,2,ross:," hey, y'know what? this is your fault! you're the one that didn't move his his appointment."
7,2,phoebe:," oh, it's my fault?! you didn't have to massage him! you could've sent him away! you could've not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back!"
7,2,ross:," he said he liked that!! oh you're right, you're right. i'm sorry."
7,2,joey:," dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"

7,2,chandler:, ehh.
7,2,monica:," eh, you work for that."
7,2,chandler:," look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
7,2,monica:, you do?!
7,2,chandler:," yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do."

7,2,chandler:," uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
7,2,monica:, what else did you think about?
7,2,chandler:," well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old."
7,2,monica:," y'know what? i i don't want a big, fancy wedding."
7,2,chandler:, sure you do.
7,2,monica:," no, i want everything you just said. i want a marriage."

7,3,phoebe:, why not?
7,3,chandler:, ''cause it's gross.
7,3,monica:, no! wait! i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie! i do stuff like this at work all the time.

7,3,chandler:," okay, we owe you a present."
7,3,ross:," the mr. bowmont , she's shown to be in one of the waterways around new york, but in reality she's in a sound stage on the warner bros. lot and we see new york from the water in some rather poor green screen shots. rachel and joey are on board.]"
7,3,joey:, look at this clown! just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. get out of the way jackass! who names his boat coast guard anyway?
7,3,rachel:, that is the coast guard. 
7,3,joey:, what are they doing out here? the coast's all the way over there. 
7,3,rachel:," joey, just ignore the boats all right? we're not finished with the lesson yet."

7,3,rachel:," oh, okay. is that what you want to do? you wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? okay, let's do that sailor joe. quick question though, what's this called?"
7,3,joey:," uh, boat rope."
7,3,rachel:, wrong! how do you get the mainsail up?
7,3,joey:," uhh, rub it?"
7,3,rachel:, no. what do you do if i say we are coming about?
7,3,joey:," i'd say, come again. no no, wait i i i know this one, i know this one, uh ' "
7,3,rachel:," time's up, now your dead."
7,3,joey:, and deaf!
7,3,rachel:," okay, you just go on and make your little jokey jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. am i getting through to you sailor?! "
7,3,joey:, yes.
7,3,rachel:," don't just say yes! this isn't a game, joey you can really get hurt out here. okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!"
7,3,joey:, i want to make a ship to shore call to chandler. 
7,3,monica:," all right, i definitely taste nutmeg."
7,3,phoebe:, you do?
7,3,monica:," you don't? well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman."
7,3,phoebe:, that and arrogance.
7,3,joey:, hey.
7,3,monica:, hey! how was sailing?
7,3,joey:, no wait no no!!!!!!!
7,3,joey:, women are mean!!! 
7,3,phoebe:, i can't believe that! now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. i wish you a long and happy marriage.
7,3,ross:, hey.
7,3,monica:, hey! how was it?
7,3,ross:," well i had a great time! umm, chancy on the other hand '"
7,3,chandler:, i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding. he even said i could call him dad.
7,3,ross:, and what did he ask you not to call him?
7,3,chandler:," daddy. all right look, here's the story. well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. so i take off my glasses and that's when in happened. "
7,3,chandler:, guys?
7,3,ross:, have a seat son. hey!! commercial break 
7,3,monica:, oh my god chandler! i can't believe it!
7,3,chandler:, i know.
7,3,monica:, you gave my father a lap dance!
7,3,chandler:, why do they put so much steam in there?!
7,3,ross:, ''cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
7,3,chandler:, why? okay? why? wh wh why did that have to happen?
7,3,phoebe:," come on, it's not that big a deal!"
7,3,chandler:, not that big a deal? there 'there was touching of things.
7,3,ross:," now, i know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?"
7,3,monica:," listen, i'm sure that dad doesn't care. he probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!"
7,3,chandler:, i don't want him to tell this story for years.
7,3,ross:," oh, but he will. he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp."
7,3,monica:, i wasn't escaping.
7,3,ross:, then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
7,3,monica:, i was trying to help out a squirrel.
7,3,ross:, you were trying to eat it! 
7,3,chandler:, if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
7,3,monica:," come on. hello? i'm sorry you have the wrong number. okay, i'll call you later dad. i love you. "
7,3,chandler:," all right, i'm off to see your dad."
7,3,ross:," whoa whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?"
7,3,rachel:," yeah, and and you better make sure he tips you this time."
7,3,chandler:," look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i don't mean his lap. and by face, i don't mean my ass. "
7,3,ross:, hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present?
7,3,rachel:," i don't know. y'know, they didn't get us anything."
7,3,ross:, thank you!
7,3,joey:, hey.

7,3,rachel:, what? i was just trying to teach you.
7,3,joey:," well, lesson learned! rachel is mean!"
7,3,ross:, yeeeeeep ' yep yep yep yep yep. i remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
7,3,rachel:," excuse me, i wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets."
7,3,ross:, you have to respect the sea! 
7,3,rachel:," look joey, i'm sorry if if you thought that was mean, but i gotta tell ya something. that was not mean. okay, my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat, i mean it was horrible. i was just being a good teacher."
7,3,joey:," does a good teacher say, ""put down the beer pinhead!?"""
7,3,rachel:," well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?"
7,3,joey:, six and a half! you knocked that last one out of my hand! remember?
7,3,rachel:," yeah, i didn't want you to get hit by the boom!"
7,3,joey:, well it hit me anyway! and it would've hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer.
7,3,rachel:," all right, y'know what? i i'm sorry. i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling."
7,3,joey:, you won't boss me around anymore?
7,3,rachel:, i won't boss you around.
7,3,joey:, and you'll be nice?
7,3,rachel:," and, i'll be nice."

7,3,ross:, let's give it a shot.
7,3,monica:," okay. man, i have not made this many cookies since i was in the ninth grade."
7,3,phoebe:," oh, what was that for? like a bake sale?"
7,3,monica:," no, just a friday night. "
7,3,ross:," ohh, these are pretty good."
7,3,phoebe:," yeah, but not as good as batch 17."
7,3,ross:, which one was that?
7,3,monica:, the ones we had right after you almost threw up.
7,3,ross:, oh yeah! batch 17 was good. i did not like batch 16. i'm okay.
7,3,phoebe:, are there anymore from the good batch? ''cause we could just work off of those.
7,3,ross:," yeah, ooh yeah, i think there is one from batch 17 left, uh ' it's batch 16! 16 people! get out of the way! "
7,3,rachel:," okay joey honey, you're doing really good! all right, now i'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. remember? remember how we talked about the port side?"
7,3,joey:, ohh yeah.

7,3,joey:, nope.
7,3,rachel:," it's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one."

7,3,rachel:," no! no no, no no no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling."
7,3,joey:," oh, y'know what? since i'm here, i think i'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side. "
7,3,rachel:," okay joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? "
7,3,joey:," uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff i didn't know there."
7,3,rachel:," joey, come on! we just went over this! "
7,3,joey:," oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. did you see it? it was gross!"
7,3,rachel:," no! all right?! i did not see the bird! i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not, because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do!"
7,3,joey:, all right that's it! you're yelling and i don't see you taking your top off! i quit!
7,3,rachel:, what do you mean you quit?! you can't quit!
7,3,joey:, why not?!

7,3,joey:, greens? i'm a tribbiani! and tribbianis quit!
7,3,rachel:," oh my god, wait did ii just said greens don't quit didn't i? did i just say greens don't quit?!"

7,3,rachel:, really?
7,3,joey:, yeah! come on.
7,3,rachel:, awww '
7,3,joey:," yeah, it's okay. i know what a mainsail is. i know, i know to duck when the boom comes across. i i know port is right."
7,3,rachel:, left.
7,3,joey:, damnit! 
7,3,phoebe:," y'know, i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. i bet she's l l lookin' up at us and smiling right now."
7,3,ross:, looking up?
7,3,phoebe:," oh yeahno, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure."
7,3,monica:," well, i've tried everything. i give up. i guess i'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  kids love that right."
7,3,ross:," aww, pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? what about, what about your sister?"
7,3,phoebe:," oh no no, no, i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body. and that's not happening ''til october 15th, 2032."
7,3,ross:," that's the day you're gonna die? seedarnit, i've got shuffleboard that day."
7,3,phoebe:, that's what you think.
7,3,monica:," well, i mean what about friends of your grandmother's? wouldn't they have the recipe?"
7,3,phoebe:," well, y'know i may have relatives in france who would know. my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, nesele tolouse."
7,3,monica:, what was her name?
7,3,phoebe:, nesele toulouse.
7,3,monica:, nestle tollhouse?!

7,3,monica:, i cannot believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
7,3,phoebe:, i know! you see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!! 
7,3,chandler:," i understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in laws. as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy i was unemployed, and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer."
7,3,chandler:," they never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. shall we? "
7,3,chandler:, so i guess we wear swimsuits in here! ending credits

7,6,chandler:, because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
7,6,monica:," no! but because he thought i was to faaaaa '. and every time i think about it, it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade! y'know, i i really think that you should apologize to julie."
7,6,chandler:, what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.
7,6,monica:," no, i know. but y'know what? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me."
7,6,chandler:," okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with! "
7,6,joey:," okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. we're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest."
7,6,ross:," no, 10 is the highest."
7,6,joey:, why is 10 the highest?
7,6,ross:," you're with monica, the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet. go! "

7,6,rachel:," look monica, getting cold feet is very common. y'know, it's it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler. and also, i ran out on a wedding. you don't get to keep the gifts."
7,6,joey:," very good! drawing on your own experience, i like that!"

7,6,rachel:, oh! that's nice.
7,6,rachel:," thank you. thank you very much. umm, i've known them separately and i've known them together and and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. so i would like to raise my glass to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey."
7,6,joey:, wow. good speech.

7,6,joey:, yeah.
7,6,phoebe:," okay, i can't believe that monica and chandler are getting married. i remember talking about this day with rachel while we were showering together, naked. "
7,6,joey:, and she's back in the game. 
7,6,chandler:," julie hi! chandler bing, i, i guess you remember me."
7,6,julie:, hello skidmark.
7,6,chandler:," it's a nickname, i'll explain later."
7,6,monica:, it's pretty clear.
7,6,chandler:," ah, uh, i owe you a long overdue apology. i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
7,6,julie:, that's why you broke up with me?
7,6,chandler:," you you you didn't know that. well, i guess my work here is done! "
7,6,joey:," all right, well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well. okay? you should be proud of yourselves. and and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. well, except for racheldamnit!"
7,6,phoebe:, really?! i won!
7,6,rachel:, what?!
7,6,ross:," i'm sorry rach, it was, it was really close."
7,6,rachel:, well then i demand a recount! 
7,6,ross:," actually, it wasn't that close."
7,6,rachel:," no! y'know what? no! no! you thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculouswe're gonna flip a coin! all right?! heads! "
7,6,phoebe:, the coins have finally forgiven me!
7,6,rachel:," well y'know what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! "
7,6,phoebe:," rach, it's gonna be okay! you guys are the best!"
7,6,joey:," boy i tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
7,6,ross:, yeah?
7,6,joey:, yeah! i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. 
7,6,ross:, why why would i care about that?
7,6,joey:," no reason, i'm just saying that uh ' that's where i'll be. "
7,6,chandler:, as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself. i think that i'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do.
7,6,monica:, why don't you just stop doing stupid things? then you wouldn't have to apologize.
7,6,chandler:, i would really love it if could do both.
7,6,monica:," all right, i 'i have to ask."
7,6,chandler:, what?
7,6,monica:, are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again?
7,6,chandler:, what?!
7,6,monica:," well, you broke up with julie grath! how much weight could she have gained?"
7,6,chandler:, a hundred and forty five pounds.
7,6,monica:, in one year?! my god what did she eat? her her family! that's not the point.
7,6,chandler:," look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15!"
7,6,monica:," well ' that's not the only time this was an issue. you remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? you called me fat."
7,6,chandler:," okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
7,6,monica:, how?
7,6,chandler:, you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back!
7,6,monica:," what if i have babies, okay? i mean i'm gonna look different. i'm okay with that, but i'm not sure that you are!"
7,6,chandler:," look you have to realize i don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is you're monica! okay? and i am in love with monica. "
7,6,monica:, keep going.
7,6,chandler:, so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you.
7,6,monica:, even if i shrink down to two inches tall?
7,6,chandler:, i'd carry you around in my pocket.
7,6,monica:, i love you. 
7,6,chandler:, skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.

7,6,rachel:," and umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know ''cause, people cry at weddings. i'm just gonna grab a couple of these."
7,6,phoebe:, this stuff is great!

7,6,phoebe:," y'know rach, i think that, i think you should be monica's made of honor."
7,6,rachel:, you do? why?
7,6,phoebe:, because i think it means more to you.
7,6,rachel:," but pheebs, y'know you earned it."
7,6,phoebe:," its fine. i mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14? "
7,6,rachel:," no, i was ten. i just developed early."

7,7,monica:," janice, what umm, what are you doing here?"
7,7,janice:," well umm, i thought i was going to go back to my apartment but then i just felt i couldn't really be alone tonight. i was wondering if i could maybe stay here with you, just i really feel that i need to be with family."
7,7,monica:, our kids are gonna call her aunt janice aren't they?
7,7,janice:," please, it's because otherwise i really don't know what i might do."
7,7,chandler:, aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
7,7,janice:, do you have any tissues?
7,7,monica:," yeah, in in in the bathroom."
7,7,janice:, okay! 
7,7,monica:, we'll just 'we'll just let her stay.
7,7,chandler:," no no no no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
7,7,monica:, kinda like your barca lounger.
7,7,chandler:, is that what you're thinking about right now?
7,7,monica:, i never stop thinking about it.
7,7,janice:," hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath."
7,7,chandler:," janice, i'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight."
7,7,janice:, why not?
7,7,chandler:," honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not. "
7,7,janice:," okay, i'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise i get very nasal. do you have a cat? ''cause it's already happening. do you hear that? "
7,7,monica:, oh my god! oh my god! you have to go!
7,7,janice:, why?
7,7,monica:, because chandler still has feelings for you!
7,7,janice:, he does?
7,7,chandler:, say again?
7,7,monica:, that's right. that's right. and that is why you can't stay here tonight. and probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
7,7,chandler:," feelings, such strong feelings."
7,7,monica:," i mean, i realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can."
7,7,janice:," oh 'my gawd, i i understand. i i am so sorry, i'll go. good bye monica , i wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper. ending credits "
7,7,ross:," don't sweat it, i've got this section covered. yeah, in fact i've got this little baby to shine in people's eye okay, see you later. "
7,7,chandler:, i just wanted to show monica your book. 
7,8,ross:, hey everybody! happy thanksgiving! 
7,8,chandler:, shhhh! 
7,8,ross:," what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year? "
7,8,chandler:," no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes. "
7,8,ross:, what? that's like insanely easy! 
7,8,chandler:," now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . "
7,8,monica:," it's a stupid game and i wasn't playing against other people, so technically i didn't lose. "
7,8,ross:, what? you forgot fourteen states? 
7,8,monica:, nobody cares about the dakotas. 
7,8,chandler:," oh, okay, time's up! "
7,8,rachel:," all right, i got 48. "
7,8,chandler:," oh that's not bad, pheebs? "
7,8,phoebe:, regular celery. 
7,8,chandler:," okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in 'vegetables, joey? "
7,8,joey:, say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game. 
7,8,ross:," wow, how many have you got? "
7,8,joey:, fifty six! opening credits 
7,8,joey:, hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports team! 
7,8,chandler:, does south oregon have a sports team? there you go. 
7,8,rachel:, how come we have one extra place setting? 
7,8,monica:, 'cause you invited your assistant. 
7,8,rachel:," oh, right. sorry. but tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending thanksgiving with her. "
7,8,monica:, oh! why didn't you tell me? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin. 
7,8,rachel:," well, i was going to, but then i figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. "
7,8,monica:," now you think i wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but i still do."
7,8,phoebe:," regular celery! oh, i already have that. "
7,8,ross:, done! with time a to spare. 
7,8,chandler:, oooh that may be a new world's record 
7,8,ross:," you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well educated adults and joey can't name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" hmm? "
7,8,chandler:," uh, magellan? you got 46 states. "
7,8,ross:, what? that's impossible. 
7,8,joey:," 46. wow! who's well educated now, mr. i forgot ten states? "
7,8,monica:," all right, i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna turn on joey's. please, watch him! do not let joey eat any of the food! "
7,8,chandler:," i am only one man! okay ross, time is up! "
7,8,ross:," no, just give me another minute. "
7,8,chandler:," look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself. "
7,8,ross:," this this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner. "
7,8,chandler:," okay, but if you can't 'no dinner! "
7,8,ross:, you're on! 
7,8,joey:," all right. don't look at my list, ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. "
7,8,monica:," hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work? "
7,8,joey:," but the drawer full of take out menus is okay, right? "
7,8,monica:," ross, i'm gonna use yours, okay? "
7,8,ross:, pshhshhh!
7,8,monica:, chandler? can you give me a hand? 
7,8,chandler:," sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. "
7,8,joey:," don't worry, chandler, it's not a globe of the united states. "
7,8,phoebe:, hey you guys i'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
7,8,ross:," phoebe, why is your bag moving? "
7,8,phoebe:," oh, it's not! "
7,8,rachel:," seriously, it's moving! "
7,8,joey:, what the hell is in there? 
7,8,phoebe:, it's just my knitting that's all! yes! i knit this. i'm very good. 
7,8,monica:, ross's apartment is nice! how come we don't hang out here more often? 
7,8,chandler:, i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something. 
7,8,monica:, that's my pie! 
7,8,chandler:, which smells delicious! 
7,8,monica:, uh oh! uh oh! 
7,8,chandler:, what? 
7,8,monica:," we left joey alone with the food! yep! yep, i knew it! there he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! "
7,8,phoebe:, hi geller bing residence. how can i help?
7,8,monica:," phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? "
7,8,phoebe:," i'm sorry, who's this? "
7,8,monica:," phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! "
7,8,chandler:," tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue! "
7,8,phoebe:," no, there's no dog here? "
7,8,monica:, yes there is! he's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand. 
7,8,phoebe:, oh my god! where are you? 
7,8,monica:, i'll be right there! 
7,8,phoebe:, they're here already? how are they doing this? 
7,8,rachel:, hi tag! what are you doing here? 
7,8,tag:," i, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good. "
7,8,rachel:," well, sure! come in! well, what what happened to your girlfriend? "
7,8,tag:, we kinda broke up this morning. 
7,8,rachel:," oh, i'm sorry. "
7,8,tag:," yeah, so she went back to ohio."
7,8,ross:, ohio!! thank you! 
7,8,chandler:, huh! where is the dog?!
7,8,ross:, what dog? there there's no dog here. 
7,8,joey:, yeah that dog left! 
7,8,monica:," phoebe! phoebe, open up! "
7,8,phoebe:, there's no dog in here. 
7,8,chandler:," phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! "
7,8,phoebe:," no that's just me coughing! oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room. "
7,8,chandler:, what is it doing here? 
7,8,phoebe:," well, i'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. wait. hello, my name is clunkers. may i please stay with you nice people?"
7,8,monica:," oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic! "
7,8,chandler:," extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! "
7,8,phoebe:," that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days "
7,8,chandler:, really? 
7,8,monica:," chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? "
7,8,chandler:, why? 
7,8,chandler:," okay, it's um '"
7,8,joey:, don't do it! 
7,8,monica:, don't do what? 
7,8,chandler:," i have to! okay? it's time! okay, i hate dogs. "
7,8,all:, what? 
7,8,phoebe:, are you crazy? 
7,8,ross:, are you out of your mind?
7,8,phoebe:, why? 
7,8,joey:, told ya. 
7,8,chandler:," they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. "
7,8,ross:," right, they are scary. ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!"
7,8,rachel:," wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies? "
7,8,chandler:, is there a puppy here? 
7,8,tag:, you don't like puppies? 
7,8,chandler:," okay, you are new!"
7,8,joey:," look, chandler, i told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. it's like ross not likin' ice cream. "
7,8,phoebe:, you don't like ice cream? 
7,8,ross:, it's too cold. 
7,8,chandler:," okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. "
7,8,ross:, it hurts my teeth.
7,8,chandler:," and i don't wanna say this, i don't you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go. oh my god!! "
7,8,ross:, how can i not get this? i'm a college professor; i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s.
7,8,monica:,1250
7,8,ross:," damn, i forgot you were here. "
7,8,phoebe:, all right. we're gonna take clunkers to ross's. we'll be back in a minute. 
7,8,rachel:," oh, wait before you guys go, can i just ask you a question? "
7,8,monica:, yeah. 
7,8,rachel:," when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? "
7,8,phoebe:," oh, i'd say about a month. "
7,8,monica:, really? i'd say 3 to 4. 
7,8,joey:, half hour. 
7,8,rachel:, interesting. 
7,8,monica:," when it's your assistant, i would say never. "
7,8,joey:," all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you? all right? because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point. "
7,8,rachel:, huh. a moo point? 
7,8,joey:," yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. it just doesn't matter. it's moo. "
7,8,rachel:," have i been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?"
7,8,monica:," please, don't listen to joey, okay. would you look at him? he he's obviously depressed. he's away from his family; he's spending thanksgiving with strangers.   what he needs right now is for you to be his friend. "
7,8,rachel:," you're right, i'm sorry. thank you. okay, that's what i'm gonna do. "
7,8,joey:," fine! take their advice. no one ever listens to me. when the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. "
7,8,rachel:, hey! 
7,8,tag:, hey. 
7,8,rachel:, how are you holding up? 
7,8,tag:, not bad. 
7,8,rachel:, yeah? i'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
7,8,tag:, thanks. 
7,8,rachel:, so were you guys together a long time? 
7,8,tag:, a year. on and off. i kinda thought we'd end up together. i don't anymore. 
7,8,rachel:, now that she broke up with you? 
7,8,tag:, yeah. 
7,8,rachel:, yeah. hmmmm. 
7,8,tag:," it's weird. i always used to assume, that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. but lately it's like what if it's not. do you ever have that feeling? "
7,8,rachel:," no 'yeah, all the time, constantly. it's terrifying. but you know that i figure it 'it has to work out. "

7,8,tag:, wait wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. 
7,8,rachel:," no? all right, here's the truth um, joey said what he said, because um, i'm attracted to you. "
7,8,tag:, wow. 
7,8,rachel:," yeah, i admit it. i have a crush on you, and uh, and, and i know that's crazy because we work together, and and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing i want to do is is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now. "

7,8,monica:, stop it. stop! okay let's go. we can be strong.
7,8,phoebe:," yeah, okay. "
7,8,monica:," oh my god! did you hear that? she said monica! oooh, i can't leave her! "
7,8,phoebe:," you know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn't even know. "
7,8,monica:, that's not gonna work. 
7,8,phoebe:, i've had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea. he's not so smart. 
7,8,monica:, hey! i didn't know either. 
7,8,phoebe:," yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? "
7,8,monica:," yeah, i knew. "

7,8,chandler:, here i am. 
7,8,phoebe:, wash your hands!!!

7,8,ross:," no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now. "
7,8,chandler:, why not? 
7,8,ross:, because you sent away the dog!
7,8,chandler:, this is ridiculous. 
7,8,ross:," oh, is it? is it? look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover. and, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. so monica and her friend 'phyllis 'take away the dog. and that was the last time we ever saw him. don't you see? this is just like that. only with a few details changed. "
7,8,joey:," okay, i'm in my sweat pants. bring on the food! what's the matter? "
7,8,chandler:," monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away. "
7,8,joey:," so? bring the dog back, you're a hero. "
7,8,chandler:," yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w w what if, what if it attacks me? "
7,8,joey:," chandler, it's like a big gerbil."
7,8,chandler:, and that doesn't scare you? 
7,8,joey:," ross, you need some help? "
7,8,ross:," from you? yes, please! "
7,8,joey:," first of all, utah? dude, you can't just make stuff up! "

7,8,joey:, hey! tag's still talking to the police. 
7,8,rachel:," yeah, ohh! why, damnit, why did i open my mouth? i have a crush on you; i am attracted to you. gee, i i know that i freaked him out "

7,8,monica:," what? why, why would... "
7,8,phoebe:," shh, wait and see. maybe we will, maybe we won't. "
7,8,chandler:," okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. y'know, for you, and ' i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which fyi ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. i couldn't find him, and i am so, so, so, sorry. but i do know where we could all go ease the pain. "
7,8,phoebe:," we have good news, look whose back! "
7,8,rachel:, hi! 
7,8,chandler:, clunkers?! oh my god! 
7,8,monica:," that's right, she came back all by herself. "

7,8,chandler:, it is so good to see you! 
7,8,phoebe:," yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building. oh, the things she must have seen! and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in ' i went to far, didn't i? when should i have stopped? "
7,8,ross:," okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. let me tell you something, i have 49 states, and there are no more! i i think, i should be able to eat something. "
7,8,chandler:, it's up to you. 
7,8,rachel:," oh, hi! how are you doing? "

7,8,tag:, okay. 
7,8,rachel:," ah, i i never should have said what i said. ity'know what? it just doesn't matter how i feel. i mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what i would love is just to go to work on monday, and and never talk about this again, okay? big day monday lots to do. so, we're okay? "
7,8,tag:," um, i'm not. "
7,8,rachel:," oh, god, i know it, that i freaked you out. "
7,8,tag:," no, you didn't. the only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us. "
7,8,rachel:, really? 
7,8,tag:," yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. "
7,8,rachel:," okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on monday. ending credits "

7,9,chandler:, that sounds like my first bike. my dad gave me his old one.
7,9,ross:, ohh.
7,9,monica:, did the girl ever let you ride it?
7,9,phoebe:, no! but she gave me the box that it came in. it had a picture of the bike on the front. so i would sit on it and my step dad would drag me around the backyard.

7,9,rachel:, oh no no no '
7,9,tag:, you wrote that you have a cute touchie?

7,10,monica:," it's not just the drum noise. every five minutes, joey throws his sticks in the air, and i have to hear, ""oh my eye! oh god, my eye!"" i mean, it is so annoying."

7,10,rachel:, phoebe?

7,13,monica:," oh please! dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out! i gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of victoria's secret catalogues, not a gym!"
7,13,ross:," come on, you know they love you."

7,13,ross:, what?
7,13,phoebe:," oh yeah, like you never called! "
7,13,supervisor:, so basically this is very easy. you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.

7,13,phoebe:," oh okay, well i'm sorry to bother you. bye bye. yeah you're right, this is easy."
7,13,supervisor:," okay, what was wrong with that call?"
7,13,phoebe:," oh well, all right 'um, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
7,13,supervisor:," they're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script."
7,13,phoebe:, oh.
7,13,supervisor:," so, i think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?"
7,13,phoebe:," no. oh wait yes! i do, i do have one question. what is toner? "
7,13,chandler:," joey! joe! full bag. beer's still cold. something terrible must've happened here! oh no no no no no no! stevie, i was never here! "

7,13,ross:, i'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
7,13,monica:," well, i don't know what's in the boxes down here, but i do know there are six or seven easy bake ovens in the attic."

7,13,ross:," oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!"
7,13,ross:," well, the white seems to be untouched. uh oh."

7,13,rachel:," joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. maybe we should actually move rosita out of here. y'know, start the heeling process?"
7,13,joey:," well, i guess you're right. maybe, maybe i'll take her down to the incinerator. it's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. she's heeled!"
7,13,rachel:, that's weird.
7,13,joey:," no it's not weird, it's a miracle!"
7,13,rachel:, it's not a miracle joey! i'm sure there's some explanation.

7,13,joey:," well, she'll understand right? it's not like i did it on purpose."

7,13,rachel:, no no no! this chair's not going anywhere.
7,13,chandler:," well, where's the logic in that?!"
7,13,rachel:," the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!"
7,13,chandler:, so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing! 
7,13,joey:, that's right!
7,13,chandler:, what are you guys? like a gang or something?!

7,14,rachel:," no, i know! i get it! it's funny!"
7,14,chandler:," no, because you're not a grandmother!"
7,14,rachel:," no i know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i don't have any of those things. that's why it's so funny. "
7,14,monica:, all you had to do was buy the card! 
7,14,ross:, hey! look who's back! it's the birthday girl! how's the birthday girl feeling?
7,14,rachel:," well, i feel fine, but i think you're bumming out the rest of the kids."
7,14,ross:, what? 
7,14,rachel:, okay! y'know what? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. all i really needed was a plan. see i wanna have three kids '
7,14,phoebe:," oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother."
7,14,rachel:, as i was saying ' i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time i'm 35 which gives me five years. i love this plan! i wanna marry this plan!
7,14,phoebe:," if you could do that, i'd marry the hippity hop."
7,14,rachel:," so, if i wanna have my kid when i'm 35, i don't have to get pregnant until i'm 34. which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! oh wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant '"
7,14,monica:," really! that long?! look all you want, it's happening!"
7,14,rachel:," no, so i don't have to get married until i'm 33! that's three years, that's three whole yearsoh, wait a minute though. i'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and i'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged ' which means i need to meet the guy by the time i'm thirty."
7,14,ross:, which is fine! because you just turned twenty eight!
7,14,rachel:," no! ross, no! it is not fine! eh eh according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry! "
7,14,joey:, will you quit hoggin' it! commercial break

7,14,monica:," you are so handsome! i wanna make love to you right here, right now! "
7,14,ross:, i really wish that you wouldn't.
7,14,chandler:," now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and don't talk to anyone."

7,15,phoebe:, or we could use it to call china. see how those guys are doing.
7,15,rachel:," what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love. i mean wouldn't that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age."
7,15,phoebe:, yeah ' that does sound great. i'm going to get the phone.

7,15,joey:, ms. monroe ' oh there you go. 
7,15,rachel:," no phoebe! you cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! okay look, i have an idea. why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone."
7,15,phoebe:," or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone."
7,15,rachel:, i don't think so.
7,15,phoebe:," fine all right, but i'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet."
7,15,rachel:," all right, first name on the speed dial is mom."
7,15,phoebe:," ohh, i lost my mom to suicide."
7,15,rachel:," okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin."

7,15,joey:, oh that's great! oh thank you so much!
7,15,cecilia:, you're so welcome.
7,15,joey:," hey! now, i've been watching some tapes, how's this? ""jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again! ever!!"""
7,15,cecilia:, is that supposed to be me?
7,15,joey:, yeah.

7,15,chandler:, oh no thanks. i don't like any thing from my scottish heritage.
7,15,ross:, what?!
7,15,chandler:," well it's just my entire family was run out of scotland by 'vikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. "
7,15,ross:," oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots."
7,15,monica:, no! no no they're not. they're still very angry! but y'know chandler is also half swedish. you know what the swedish people are famous for? sitting down and being quiet.
7,15,ross:, well yeah yeah the scottish history is so much more '
7,15,monica:, you can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
7,15,ross:, how did you know about that?!
7,15,chandler:, we heard you play all the way from your apartment!
7,15,ross:, were you the ones called the cops?!
7,15,chandler:," that's not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding."
7,15,ross:, why not?
7,15,chandler:, because we hate them.
7,15,ross:, come on that's not fair! i mean you haven't even heard me play!
7,15,chandler:, we have heard you play.
7,15,ross:," no, you've heard my practice. okay? just just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and i'm not going to tell you what song i'm gonna play either. but uh, let's just say when it's over i'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration. "
7,15,cecilia:," so, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. so, when jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. you try."
7,15,joey:, okay! all right!
7,15,cecilia:," no, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! he's not finding it out for the first time! so, try it again."
7,15,joey:, okay. okay. 
7,15,cecilia:," right. he's not angry at the room either. try it again, he owns it! he owns the room. it is his. he owns, owns, owns, owns the room! he owns it!! all right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. oh well, i'm gonna miss this woman so much. i don't know what i'm going to do! i mean, it's been 20 years of my life."
7,15,joey:," oh wellhey hey! maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. y'know? it'll it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. you're so talented."
7,15,cecilia:," i am. i am, but i don't know you know. an actor of a certain age is not that easy."
7,15,joey:," hey that's not true! look at uh, look at angela lansbangelina jolie!"
7,15,cecilia:," i probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know i just got so comfy here! and ' ohh, i turned down some amazing work!"
7,15,joey:, like like what?
7,15,cecilia:," well, let's just say if i left 15 years ago, the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today!"
7,15,joey:, wow!
7,15,cecilia:," but ' well now, now's a different time for me. "
7,15,joey:," oh hey come on, don't don't don't do this! umm, look let let me tell you something, okay? now when i watch you do a scene, i'm thinking, ""boy, she she is a great actress!"" uh but but, i am also thinking, ""she is hot!"""

7,15,joey:, yeah! okay. 
7,15,cecilia:," that was good, that was really good. but i i think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like ' commercial break "

7,18,monica:," oh, i haven't had that feeling since i first started going out with chandler. wow, i'm never gonna have that feeling again am i?"
7,18,phoebe:, you sound like a guy.
7,18,monica:," no, a guy would be saying, ""i'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."" oh my god! i'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! i've been so busy planning the wedding that i forgot about all the things that i'd be giving up! i mean, i 'i'm never gonna have a first kiss again."
7,18,phoebe:, you'll have a last kiss. 
7,18,ross:, can i ask you something? have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
7,18,joey:, is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

7,19,monica:, yeah?
7,19,chandler:," technically we could have sex again. what do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
7,19,monica:," the wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
7,19,chandler:, that's me! come on!
7,19,monica:," okay. but wait, we can't. my cousin cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch."
7,19,chandler:," well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
7,19,monica:, shrill?! the wedding is back on! 
7,19,cassie:, i thought i heard voices. you must be chandler.
7,19,chandler:, hi! nice to meet you!
7,19,cassie:, nice to meet you too.
7,19,monica:," so, are you ready to go?"
7,19,cassie:, yeah. 
7,19,monica:, chandler!
7,19,chandler:, i'll be right with you. 
7,19,monica:, cassie needs to stay at your place.
7,19,ross:, whatwhy?
7,19,monica:, because purvry perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
7,19,ross:, what?! chandler she's our cousin!
7,19,chandler:, i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. it's called being a good conversationalist. watch. say something.
7,19,monica:, you were staring about eight inches south of there.
7,19,ross:," fine, she can stay at my place. by the way, what what does cassie even look like now."
7,19,monica:, she looks exactly like aunt marilyn.
7,19,chandler:," umm, so this aunt marilyn is is is is she coming to the wedding?"
7,19,monica:, wafer thin ice! 
7,19,joey:, hi hi joey.
7,19,joey:," actually, i tried to call to you. you didn't need to come down here today."
7,19,joey:, wait joey! you didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
7,19,joey:," well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow."
7,19,joey:, oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
7,19,joey:," terrific! well uh, there's one more thing. uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't jewish. so ' "
7,19,joey:," so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not jewish. do you know what i'm saying?"
7,19,joey:, okay.
7,19,joey:, an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be '
7,19,joey:, barmifsaed? 
7,19,monica:, so to get this part you can't be?
7,19,joey:, nope.
7,19,monica:, but you are?
7,19,joey:, yep.
7,19,monica:, but you told them you weren't?
7,19,joey:, that's right.
7,19,monica:, wow! wow! and it's definitely all gone? there's nothing there to work with? what were you thinking?
7,19,joey:," i don't know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ''em you can! and just figure out how to do it later."
7,19,monica:, joey! this is not like learning to ride a horse! this is like learning to 'grow a turtleneck!
7,19,joey:, i kn i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
7,19,monica:," oh my god, what are you gonna do?!"
7,19,joey:, i just have to call my agent and tell her i can't do the part. 
7,19,monica:, unless!
7,19,joey:, unless what?
7,19,monica:," well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion."
7,19,joey:, like what?
7,19,monica:," well i'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head i'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat. "
7,19,phoebe:," hey! i've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone."
7,19,rachel:," okay. okay. all right, you take care of that. and meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list."
7,19,phoebe:," okay. okay! well okay, who do we know that's coming? me. are you?"
7,19,monica:, hey!
7,19,phoebe:, hey!

7,19,rachel:, have at it.
7,19,monica:," okay. all right, turkey. eh, that won't work. cheese? that won't work. olive loaf? i hope that won't work."
7,19,rachel:, are you makin' him a sandwich?
7,19,monica:, okay.
7,19,monica:, i guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! 
7,19,rachel:, we have to get her a present?!
7,19,phoebe:, okay but look! look at what i got! it's her address book! we have a guest list!

7,19,ross:," oh right. right. ooh, remember the time i uh, i pinned you down and tickled you ''til you cried? we're probably too old to do that now."
7,19,cassie:," i'll always remember that summer, because it's when i got all of these freckles. "
7,19,ross:, uh huh! uh huh! and and and i'll always remember that summer because that's when i realized that we are related.

7,21,ross:," hi, i'm ross's little sister."

7,21,monica:, ennnh. 
7,21,monica:," ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!"

7,21,rachel:," well, y'know, sometimes that helps. "

7,21,chandler:," okay! okay! okay! i'll do it!  oh god, i thought ' wait a minute, i i can do this. i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than i ever thought i could be. and if you'll let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. monica, will you marry me?"

7,21,joey:," how is ""monica, i love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?"
7,21,ross:, how's monica coming along with her vows?
7,21,phoebe:," well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, ''cause she's not so good at the writing."
7,21,ross:, i can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!

7,22,rachel:, come on ross give me the keys! monica does not know what she's talking about! i am an excellent driver!
7,22,ross:, you're fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver.
7,22,rachel:," well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader. "
7,22,ross:, did you see the look that girl just gave me? huh? she must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
7,22,rachel:, i think she's checking out your beehive ross.

7,22,rachel:, alimony. 
7,22,monica:," chandler, we still haven't gotten an rsvp from your dad."
7,22,chandler:," oh! right. umm, maybe that's because i didn't send him an invitation."
7,22,monica:, chandler! he's your father; he should be at the wedding.
7,22,chandler:, i don't even know the man. okay? we're not the close. i haven't seen him in years.
7,22,monica:, well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
7,22,chandler:," well he doesn't have to know! it's not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas."
7,22,phoebe:," ooh, i think i wanna trade circles."
7,22,chandler:," trust me, you don't want him there either. okay? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back less dress."
7,22,monica:, so what! as long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil i don't care.
7,22,phoebe:," okay, i think i need to do some shopping. "
7,22,rachel:," ahhh! ooh, nice! "
7,22,rachel:, my god!
7,22,ross:, what do you think you're doing?!
7,22,rachel:, just washing the windshield. 
7,22,ross:, there is no way i am letting you drive this car! so why don't you just hand over the keys?
7,22,rachel:," she puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is? it's a tradition left over from porsche's racing history. the world's greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday.  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat belts, put the car in gear and start it. the driver's left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24 hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat belts with his right hand. that's why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}"
7,22,ross:, no ah ah ah! do not start this car! okay! okay! i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! 
7,22,rachel:," look ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!"
7,22,ross:, with you?! yeah right!
7,22,rachel:, all right. 
7,22,ross:, okay! okay! okay!

8,5,monica:," because he's terrible! okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
8,5,phoebe:," well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. and besides i've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two."
8,5,monica:," well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
8,5,phoebe:," but monica, he loves his job so much! can you just give him another chance? please?"
8,5,monica:," all right, but if if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!"

8,5,monica:," no! no no! he is totally incompetent. i called the chef who recommended him to me. he said, ""ha ha! gotcha!"""
8,5,phoebe:," okay. okay, but you can't fire him today."
8,5,monica:, why not?!
8,5,phoebe:, because i'm dumping him today.
8,5,monica:, what?! you said he was sweet!
8,5,phoebe:," he is sweet. he's too sweet. he calls me all the time. ""so did did you get home from work okay?"" ""did did you get out of the shower okay?"""
8,5,monica:, just don't pick up your phone.
8,5,phoebe:," then he comes over! ""i'm so worried about you."" uck! be a man!"
8,5,monica:, what? so now i'm not allowed to fire him?
8,5,phoebe:," you can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself."
8,5,monica:," okay well then, i'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
8,5,phoebe:," are you kidding?! another week with that sip, i'll kill myself!"
8,5,monica:," okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!"
8,5,phoebe:, okay. but the question is who's gonna go first. ''cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
8,5,monica:, what do you mean?
8,5,phoebe:," come on! the boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! and the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!"
8,5,monica:, i wanted to do this days ago so i think i should go first.
8,5,phoebe:," all right, that makes sense. ugh. butscrew you i'm going first! "
8,5,bob:," hey toby, you got a sec?"
8,5,chandler:," sure, what's up?"

8,5,rachel:," hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why i'm not drinking on this date tonight. ""umm, i'm a recovering alcoholic. i'm a mormon,"" or ""i got so hammered last night i'm still a little drunk?"""

8,7,ross:, yes?
8,7,ross:, hi. i'm ross geller. i live in the building.

8,7,chandler:, she must've been planning this for years!
8,7,monica:, i will prove it to you! okay? about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain!
8,7,chandler:," honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?"
8,7,monica:, i guess.
8,7,chandler:," so, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go 'snooping around her crotch?"
8,7,monica:, fine. i'm just glad i didn't give her my secret ingredient.
8,7,chandler:," out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?"
8,7,monica:, yeah! 
8,7,phoebe:, hi!
8,7,eric:," come in, i'm so glad you're here."

8,7,phoebe:," look eric, turn around. look, i like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. y'know? this is our first date y'know? first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ''ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and ' 'second kisses. "

8,8,chandler:, i can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
8,8,joey:," wait! wait! maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do."
8,8,chandler:," could be. i mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. ma'am, are you also a stripper?"
8,8,hooker:," uh, no. but i could pretend to strip, but that's gonna cost extra. okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking ' "
8,8,joey:," maybe monica's playing a joke on ya. y'know? getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny."
8,8,chandler:," that is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone."
8,8,joey:, i bet ross was in on it too. i mean he was conveniently busy.
8,8,hooker:, do you mind if i smoke in here?
8,8,chandler:," oh actually, i'd rather you 'yeah, go ahead. we're gonna have to burn that room down anyway. "
8,8,mona:, how could you have kept all of this from me?
8,8,ross:, but what?! you figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped rachel!
8,8,ross:, hey! i did not dump rachel! nor are we still together. can i just ' why don't we just let the machine get that?

8,8,stu:," either that or she's just the best, most expensive date i ever had. "
8,8,joey:, maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
8,8,chandler:, why would she do that?
8,8,joey:," maybe she wants you to learn something. huh? now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?"
8,8,chandler:, this is the worst bachelor party ever!

8,9,phoebe:," so how did this happen? did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?"
8,9,ross:," i was working late in the library one afternoon. it was just the two of us. she needed some help with her word jumble. and one thing led to another. if you must know, anita was very gentle and tender. may she rest in peace '"

8,10,bobby:," yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it."
8,10,joey:, well what am i supposed to do?
8,10,rachel:, you're supposed to realize that they are adults! and that they can make their own decisions.

8,11,phoebe:, ugh! women!
8,11,ross:," i know! i know! why do you guys need to have this conversation?! huh? i mean no self respecting man would ask a woman, ""so, where is this going?"""
8,11,rachel:, uh ross? you asked me that.
8,11,ross:," hey! you were a closed book! okay? i'm not a mind reader! besides, i hate those conversations. i'm horrible at them. really! maybe maybe i need kind of a gesture. y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it."
8,11,monica:, like asking her to move in with you?
8,11,ross:, smaller than that.
8,11,monica:, making her a mixed tape?
8,11,ross:," uh, bigger than that."
8,11,phoebe:, give her a key to your apartment.
8,11,ross:, whoa hello! we were closer with the mixed tape.
8,11,monica:," all right. have you said, ""i love you?"" you could say, i love you."
8,11,ross:," yeah i i don't i don't think i'm quite there yet, but i could say i looove spending time with you."
8,11,phoebe:," no, we hate that."
8,11,monica:, that is a slap in the face.
8,11,ross:," forget it. i iy'know what? i'll just have the conversation. i'll just say i like things the way they are, and hope for the best. what do you think rach?"
8,11,rachel:," i think, if it was a little colder in here i could see your nipples through that sweater. "

8,12,chandler:, because it's awesome.
8,12,monica:, you think this is clever?
8,12,chandler:," well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after a s s it is a bit of a challenge."
8,12,monica:," hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty."
8,12,chandler:, it is when you put it together with that one.
8,12,monica:," ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. but ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there."
8,12,chandler:," come on, he won't even know what they mean."

8,12,rachel:, i know!
8,12,joey:, i never laughed so harddid you see the wine come out of my nose?
8,12,rachel:," joey, i think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose."
8,12,joey:," i gotta say, i never knew i could enjoy the non sex part of the date so much."
8,12,rachel:, well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
8,12,joey:, huh. huh.
8,12,rachel:," all right, now don't judge me. i normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. i'm ripping into this swan."

8,12,rachel:," no, i don't want to tell you."

8,12,rachel:, because it's embarrassing.
8,12,joey:," more embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! i didn't say raspberry before did i? all right just just tell me rach, just tell me!"
8,12,rachel:," okay. all right, stand up. well, when we're at the door, i lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then i make this sound, ""hmmm."" okay, i know it doesn't sound like anything, but i swear it works."

8,13,chandler:," honey, it's not the bath i enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady."
8,13,monica:," oh, baths are so relaxing!"
8,13,chandler:, really? what do you do? you just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
8,13,monica:," how dirty do you think i am? i'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! it would take all of your stress away."
8,13,chandler:," honey, it's 2 on a wednesday and i'm watching road rules, how stressed do you think i am?"

8,13,joey:, yeah.
8,13,chandler:," yes. when monica and i were in london, we were both in london."
8,13,joey:," you know what? this is a bad idea. forget it. forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me."
8,13,chandler:, if that. 
8,13,rachel:," hi! oh, ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!"
8,13,ross:, right.
8,13,phoebe:," hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?"
8,13,ross:," no no, we talked about it. we don't want to know. all we care about is that it's happy and healthy."
8,13,rachel:, yep! happy and healthy! and cute!
8,13,ross:, and smart!
8,13,rachel:, popular.
8,13,ross:, with an aptitude for science.
8,13,phoebe:, are you two talking about the same baby? hey! have you started off thinking of names yet?

8,13,rachel:, really?!
8,13,phoebe:," uh huh! if it's a girl, phoebe, and if it's a boy, phoebo!"
8,13,ross:," maybe. but it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? uh, rach rach, what were you thinking? "
8,13,rachel:," okay! i was thinking if it's a girl, how about sandrine? it's french."
8,13,ross:, huh. that's a really pretty name for for an industrial solvent.
8,13,rachel:," okay fine, what do you have?"
8,13,ross:," well, ok, it's for a boy. well, i know it's a little out there, but 'darwin."
8,13,rachel:," wow, oh my god, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard."
8,13,phoebe:," yeah, by sandrine."
8,13,ross:, you're just saying that 'cause i said no to your name!
8,13,rachel:," i'm really, really not."
8,13,phoebe:, how how about you each get five vetoes?
8,13,ross:, all right.
8,13,rachel:, all right.
8,13,ross:, that sounds fair.
8,13,rachel:," yeah! i don't think you're going to need it though. okay, check this out. if it's a girl, rain."
8,13,ross:, veto.
8,13,rachel:, why?
8,13,ross:," rain? hi. hi, my name is rain. i have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat."
8,13,phoebe:, i know her! i bought homemade soap from her at a dead show!
8,13,ross:," okay, how about, for a guy, thatcher?"
8,13,rachel:," ross, why do you hate our child?"
8,13,ross:," fine, you go."
8,13,rachel:," okay, james."

8,13,rachel:, veto.
8,13,phoebe:," is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good? "
8,13,chandler:, hey.
8,13,monica:," boy, do i have a surprise for you!"
8,13,chandler:, sex on the balcony?
8,13,monica:," no, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?"
8,13,chandler:, what is it?
8,13,monica:, i drew you a bath!
8,13,chandler:," honey, i don't like baths! could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?"
8,13,monica:," please, could you just try it for me? come on, i used all my best stuff! i i i lit some candles. i put on some music. i used bath salts, plus bubble bath! and got you this little plastic navy ship. so it's a boy bath!"
8,13,chandler:," well, this does butch it up a bit."
8,13,monica:," i swear, if you try it, you will love it!"
8,13,chandler:," all right, if i do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
8,13,monica:, absolutely. 
8,13,monica:, bet i know how that discussion's going to go. 
8,13,chandler:," all right, this isn't so bad. i like the flower smell! which is okay, because i've got my boat."
8,13,monica:, so?
8,13,chandler:, oh my god.
8,13,monica:," i told you you were a bath person! hey, when you get out, maybe i can give you a facial!"
8,13,chandler:, i'm going to need a bigger boat. 
8,13,ross:," i don't think you had an open mind about the name ruth. i mean, come on, little ruthie geller, how how cute is that?"
8,13,rachel:," okay! all your tests look fine. now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?"
8,13,ross:," uh, no. no, we're not."
8,13,rachel:, that's right. but if you don't want to know '
8,13,ross:," no, no, we want to wait, right?"
8,13,rachel:," oh, i'll be right back. and, uh, i know it's really not my place, but please don't name your child phoebo."
8,13,rachel:," so, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?"
8,13,ross:," what? rach! come on, that's terrible! they're 'uh 'they're babies. they're they're all beautiful."
8,13,rachel:, third one from the left?
8,13,ross:," yeah, why is it staring at me? i think it knows i'm talking about it. don't don't youwhwhahey!! "
8,13,rachel:, what?! 
8,13,ross:, you're looking!
8,13,rachel:, i didn't!
8,13,ross:, i saw you!
8,13,rachel:," okay fine, i did. but i didn't see anything, i swear."
8,13,ross:, shame on you! ugly baby judges you!
8,13,rachel:," okay, but ross just listen to me '"
8,13,ross:," no, no, no, no! don't tell me! i don't want to know!"
8,13,rachel:," but i couldn't even if i wanted to, because i don't know! i swear; i didn't see anything, and i don't want to know! it was just a momentary lapse."
8,13,ross:, momentary lapse. don't don't you have any self control?
8,13,rachel:," okay, a couple months late on the lecture, ross. "
8,13,monica:, hello?
8,13,chandler:," i'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? i think there's something wrong."
8,13,monica:, you know what? i i think i'll wait out here. 
8,13,chandler:, i'm in the bathtub.
8,13,monica:, oh. what's wrong?
8,13,chandler:," i drew my own bath, but i did it wrong! the water's tepid. the salt didn't dissolve and is now ' lodged places. and the scents i used don't compliment each other. eucalyptus and chamomileoh!"
8,13,monica:, what?
8,13,chandler:, the bath salts! they're starting to effervesce! it's different. it's interesting.
8,13,monica:," okay, let's talk about something else."
8,13,chandler:," yeah! sure, sure. so, what was going on with you today? oh oh oh!"
8,13,monica:," well, i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey. he was talking about rules and right and wrong and '"
8,13,chandler:, i had the exact same conversation.
8,13,monica:, you did? what was he talking about?
8,13,chandler:, i don't know! joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth!
8,13,monica:, that was a long night.
8,13,chandler:," all right, let's break this down. what exactly did he say to you?"
8,13,monica:," okay, he was talking about rules."
8,13,chandler:, uh huh.
8,13,monica:," umm, and looking at people differently."
8,13,chandler:, he didn't say anything about that to me.
8,13,monica:, what did he tell you?
8,13,chandler:," he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules."
8,13,monica:," okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone."
8,13,chandler:, but what did he mean by rules?
8,13,monica:, wait a minute! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in!
8,13,chandler:, because he was looking at her differently.
8,13,monica:," and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!"
8,13,chandler:, my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london!
8,13,phoebe:, you guys?
8,13,monica:, just a minute! that's mrs. tribbiani!
8,13,chandler:, you don't say anything.
8,13,monica:," why would i say anything? that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! and they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?"
8,13,chandler:, i'm not going to let you say anything.
8,13,monica:, you just stay here! 
8,13,chandler:," oh, god! "
8,13,phoebe:," oh, hey, monica, i brought back your iron."
8,13,monica:," oh, you had that? "
8,13,phoebe:, uh huh.
8,13,monica:," i thought i lost it. i got a new one, like, a month ago."
8,13,phoebe:," oh, just as well, i broke this one. "
8,13,phoebe:, what?
8,13,monica:, nothing.
8,13,phoebe:, okay.
8,13,monica:," i mean, i i, i really shouldn't say. i mean, i'm really not supposed to."
8,13,phoebe:, fine.
8,13,monica:, it's a humdinger!
8,13,phoebe:, then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
8,13,monica:, somebody likes you!
8,13,phoebe:, is it chandler?
8,13,monica:, no!
8,13,phoebe:," well, then tell him to stop staring!"
8,13,monica:, it's joey!
8,13,phoebe:, really?! joey?! you don't say.
8,13,monica:, is it something you'd be interested in?
8,13,phoebe:," i don't know, i don't know, i don't know. you know, i mean, on the one hand, mother may i? but y'know on the other hand ' no. no, i can't. we're friends. no, oh, no. i don't want to risk what we have."
8,13,monica:," i guess that makes sense. so, you think you're going to talk to him?"
8,13,phoebe:," sure, yeah. i mean, it's joey. i don't want him to get hurt. well, i must say, i am on fire! first chandler, now joey!"
8,13,monica:," not chandler, just joey."
8,13,phoebe:, sure. commercial break 
8,13,rachel:, hey.
8,13,ross:, hey.
8,13,rachel:, you know what? i've been thinking about it. i'm really coming around on the name ruth. i think i would actually consider naming our child that.
8,13,ross:," rach, i i can't tell you how how much that means to me! ohh ' wait a minute. wait a minute. you you hated the name ruth! why why would you change your mind? unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. you did see the folder. you know it's a boy!"
8,13,rachel:, i didn't see anything! i actually changed my mind about the name.
8,13,ross:," i don't think so! you're just giving me ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia."
8,13,rachel:, i wouldsequoia?
8,13,ross:, veto.
8,13,rachel:, fine.
8,13,ross:," unless ' you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named ruth! well, i'm not falling for that! okay? ruth is off the table!"
8,13,rachel:," but ross, you want the name ruth!"
8,13,ross:, not like this! 
8,13,phoebe:, hey.
8,13,joey:," hey. well, what's up?"
8,13,phoebe:," umm, joey, i know."
8,13,joey:, what?
8,13,phoebe:, i knooow.
8,13,joey:, whaaat?
8,13,phoebe:, i know about your feelings.
8,13,joey:, oh my god. you do?
8,13,phoebe:," yes, and i'm sorry. i i know things worked out for chandler and monica, but that's very rare."
8,13,joey:," i know. i know. and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. i mean, it's rachel for god sakes."
8,13,phoebe:," for god sakes, it's rachel!"
8,13,joey:, i know. i know. and she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! she's my pregnant friend who's ross' ex!
8,13,phoebe:, yeah that's rachel. beat me over the head with it.
8,13,joey:," what am i going to do? you know, and i keep, i keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i don't like about her. you want to hear it?"
8,13,phoebe:, yeah.
8,13,joey:," she made me switch to light mayo. that's it! that's all i got! and, you know what? it tastes the same and my pants fit better!"
8,13,phoebe:," joey, i just think you're getting worked up over nothing. this is probably just a crush."
8,13,joey:, you think?
8,13,phoebe:," absolutely! y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away."
8,13,joey:," yeah, just a crush! that's all this is! it's a crush! i'm joey; i don't get deep feelings."
8,13,phoebe:," that's right, there you go! crushes happen all the time! i know i've had them for all you guys. well, except for ross and chandler. and i'm sure you've had them for us."
8,13,joey:, not really.
8,13,phoebe:, mm hmm. throw me a bone here. 
8,13,ross:," so, i uh ' i called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby."
8,13,rachel:, what?
8,13,ross:, that's right. the student has become the master.
8,13,rachel:," ross, i swear, i don't know."
8,13,ross:," oh, come on, you know it's a girl!"
8,13,rachel:, a what?!
8,13,ross:, you really didn't know?

8,13,monica:, what do you think you're doing?
8,13,chandler:, l leaving my troubles behind?
8,13,monica:," i know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum."
8,13,chandler:," oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed."
8,13,monica:," fine, you can have the bath, but i am taking your boat. now you're just a girl in a tub! "

8,14,chandler:, i don't know! what could she possibly be hiding in here that i can't see?!
8,14,joey:," i don't know. ooh, i bet it's richard."
8,14,chandler:, why would monica be keeping richard in here?
8,14,joey:," well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. you being the cake and richard being the too. or!"
8,14,chandler:, and here we go '
8,14,joey:," i saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! stupid closet full of bugs!"
8,14,rachel:," joey. joey, something feels weird and not good weird. i don'twhoa!! "
8,14,joey:," oh hey whoa whoa, don't worry. okay. when my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing."

8,14,rachel:," hmm, mild discomfort. so i take it you've had one of these braxton thingies?"
8,14,joey:, absolutely.
8,14,joey:," no no. contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are, but she's fine."
8,14,rachel:, thank you doctor. oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
8,14,joey:, calm?! i wasn't calm! i've never been more scared in all my life!
8,14,rachel:, but wait you said everything was gonna be okay.

8,14,ross:, is everything okay?
8,14,rachel:," yeah, everything's fine!"
8,14,ross:," your page said come to the hospital, what? what was it? what happened?"
8,14,joey:, something called braxton hicks contractions.
8,14,ross:," oh. oh. thank god, most women don't even feel them."
8,14,rachel:," okay, no uterus, no opinion."
8,14,joey:," hey uh, what's with the candy?"
8,14,ross:, oh when you beeped me i was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
8,14,rachel:, oh you went to the movies by yourself?

8,14,rachel:," oh, i gotta go back in there."
8,14,ross:, what? why? what's wrong?

8,14,ross:," no really, you tell me what's up."
8,14,rachel:, i i forgot my underwear. 
8,14,ross:," so, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital."
8,14,joey:," oh hey, don't worry about it man. don't worry about it, no big deal."
8,14,ross:," uh, if you have any questions, here's some information on braxton hicks. oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. you're gonna make a wonderful father."
8,14,joey:," oh uh, hey. not as good as this guy! he brought twizlers! commercial break "
8,14,chandler:, there has got to be a way!
8,14,joey:," easy there captain kirk. oh, do you have a bobby pin?"
8,14,chandler:," yeah. oh no wait, i'm not an nine year old girl."
8,14,joey:, then why do you throw like one?
8,14,chandler:, maybe monica has a bobby pin.
8,14,joey:," sure. ""monica."""
8,14,chandler:," so, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming?"
8,14,joey:," uh, really good. really good. yeah, i should be ready to kill myself any day now. wow, you sure found that quick. i justi wish i didn't feel this way about rachel anymore, y'know? i wish things could go back to normal. i mean, i love living with her and god, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now i think 'i think ross feels left out. y'know? when i had to take rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought i was the father. god ' you should've seen the look on ross's face. by the way, i have no idea what i'm doing here. for all i know i'm just locking it more. oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?"
8,14,chandler:, that's a good idea.
8,14,joey:, yeah.
8,14,chandler:," okay. so uh, ross is kinda bummed huh?"
8,14,joey:," oh, i just 'i feel terrible."
8,14,chandler:," well, it's not your fault. what are you gonna do? not take her to the hospital? y'know? you're doing nothing wrong. except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. richard? if if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card? "
8,14,monica:, hey.
8,14,phoebe:, hey.
8,14,monica:," i gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. that massage felt so good!"

8,14,phoebe:," yeah, and it really freaked me out! and after a while i even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on."
8,14,monica:, what?! you're crazy! there's nothing sexual about the noises i make!
8,14,phoebe:, really? there's nothing sexual about this? oooh. oo god! ohh. ohhhh. ohh. what are you looking at?! i mean hi.
8,14,monica:," oh mythis is so embarrassing. oh my god, i'm never gonna get massaged again!"
8,14,phoebe:," no, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! no look, i have, i have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!"
8,14,monica:, really?!
8,14,phoebe:," well not clients, lovers. but let's just y'know, try it again. come back and and we'll work through it."
8,14,monica:, are you sure?

8,14,phoebe:," great! okay, if you'll just excuse me. so, did you hear something you liked? "

8,14,ross:," i i'm sorry rach, i didn't know. are you gonna be okay?"
8,14,rachel:," yeah, i'll be fine. but could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when i get out there?"
8,14,joey:, i'm on it! 
8,14,ross:, i can't believe this! i shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
8,14,joey:, dude relax! it could happen to anyone.
8,14,ross:," yeah? not to you, because you know this stuff. i don't know any of it and i'm the father. i wish i'd be more involved y'know."
8,14,rachel:," well, if anyone is keeping score, i no longer eat tuna."
8,14,joey:," hey uh, can i, can i talk to you guys for a second?"

8,14,rachel:, yeah?
8,14,joey:, maybe you two should live together.
8,14,rachel:, are you asking me to move out? do you not want me here?
8,14,joey:," oh no no, no no i love living with you. it just seems that 'if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father."
8,14,rachel:," but joey, i don't think ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. i mean or he does."
8,14,ross:, no i i i would love to be around for you and the baby. and we we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
8,14,rachel:," but ross, its you and me!"
8,14,ross:, so? sure! but it it wouldn't be anything romantic. and i'm i'm dating monadamnit mona! i was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! what is wrong with me?!

8,14,chandler:, are you okay?
8,14,joey:," are you kidding me? i'm great! yeah, i'm uh; i'm better than great. i am good. and now that she's gone, i can uh, i can do all this stuff around here that i couldn't do before. y'know? like umm, i can walk around naked again. y'know? i can uh, i can watch porn in the living room. right? this is uh, this is good for me. y'know? i like being on my own, i'm uh, better off this way. i'm uh, a lone wolf. y'know? a loner. alone. all alone. forever. what's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! closing credits "

8,15,monica:," is this the video of the baby being born? sweetie, this is phoebe's. why were you even watching it?"
8,15,chandler:, i thought 'maybe 'you got me porn for valentine's day.
8,15,monica:," chandler, if you thought i was going to get you porn for valentine's day ' you were right! apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! yeah, it got four starts! oh, wait a minute. those aren't stars. anyway, you want to take a look?"
8,15,chandler:," well, i'm not really in a sexy mood right now."
8,15,monica:," honey, what's going on?"
8,15,chandler:," well, remember the first time we saw jaws?"

8,15,mona:," seriously, what is she doing?"
8,15,ross:," uh 'lately, she just likes hanging out here."
8,15,mona:, why?
8,15,ross:, i think she's lonely.
8,15,mona:," okay, but it's valentine's day!"
8,15,ross:, i know.
8,15,mona:, can't we just ask her to go?

8,15,rachel:, i'm just going to grab the phone.
8,15,mona:," oh, rachel! wait! hey, i hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, but, um ' what are you doing?"
8,15,rachel:," oh, i'm sorry! do you need the phone?"
8,15,mona:," no, no. listen, ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?"
8,15,rachel:," but, but, mona, i live here."
8,15,ross:, happy valentine's day! 'or something to remember me by. 
8,15,monica:, how long has it been this time?
8,15,chandler:, 90 seconds.
8,15,monica:, that's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it 'except all i did was think about it.
8,15,chandler:," you know, it haunts me? up ''til now, the worst thing i ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. after this, i would gladly make that my screensaver!"
8,15,monica:," okay, well, we have to get past this! why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?"
8,15,chandler:, i can do that.
8,15,monica:, okay. 
8,15,chandler:, okay. now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair. 
8,15,monica:," oh, thank god!"
8,15,chandler:," oh, i know!"
8,15,monica:, come in!
8,15,rachel:," hi! i'm so sorry to barge in on your valentine's, but i had to get away from all the yelling. mona is dumping ross."

8,15,chandler:, poor ross. 
8,15,chandler:," oh, great. we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!"
8,15,monica:," rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? it's here."
8,15,chandler:, don't watch it.
8,15,rachel:, why? you saw it? is it scary?
8,15,chandler:," well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."
8,15,rachel:," well, now, wait. now i'm all freaked out. come on, you guys will watch it with me."
8,15,monica:," no, but i will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!"
8,15,rachel:," c'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!"
8,15,monica:," she's right 'of course not. honey, get the tape."
8,15,chandler:," this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. okay, here we go."
8,15,rachel:," okay. ooh, my! woah! why is that baby torturing that woman?!"
8,15,chandler:, why have i seen this thing three times?!
8,15,monica:, it's 'still beautiful.
8,15,rachel:, uh! it's horrible!
8,15,monica:," i know! i know, i'm so sorry for you!"
8,15,rachel:," oh, my god! "
8,15,chandler:," wait, you guys, look!"

8,15,ross:, uh 'mona just dumped me.
8,15,joey:," oh, man, i'm sorry. why?"
8,15,ross:," well, with everything that's been going on lately, i haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. you know, i, uh, i didn't tell her i got rachel pregnant. i gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! and then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me. in a way, i actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?"
8,15,joey:," still, that really sucks, man. especially on valentine's day."
8,15,ross:," yeah. wait a minute. what are you doing here? joey tribbiani without a date on valentine's day? what's going on, huh? girl trouble?"
8,15,joey:, sort of.

8,15,joey:," sometimes i think maybe she could. but it doesn't matter, because i can't do anything about it."
8,15,ross:, why not?
8,15,joey:," well, it's complicated. she's with this other guy. for a long time. someone from work, too. and i could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends."
8,15,ross:," so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh ' is he still in love with her?"

8,15,ross:," okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it. how often does this happen to you, huh? you owe it to yourself."

8,16,phoebe:," uh huh, and you?"
8,16,chandler:," no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i don't think they exist."

8,16,phoebe:," well last night, i met monica's."
8,16,chandler:, what?

8,16,phoebe:," oh, i'm so sorry. um, and maybe i'm wrong! i buty'know i'm gonna go out with him again, i'll find out more."

8,16,ross:," oh my god! what if, what if they get married? then he'd be the stepfather of my child."
8,16,monica:," honey, i don't think that's something we need to worry about! first of all he's he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. and even if he did you have no idea how she'd react."
8,16,ross:," sure, because women never like joey. y'know, i think he's a virgin."
8,16,monica:, joey 'he's not even thinking about going after rachel!
8,16,ross:, he's not?
8,16,monica:," no! all he's thinking about is how you're taking this! i mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. he's talking about moving to vermont."

8,16,monica:, he says he wants to leave the country. he thinks you hate him.
8,16,ross:," hate him? i ' no, i don't hate him. it's just it's rachel, y'know?"
8,16,monica:," honey i can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. but, i don't want you to lose joey over it. and right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend."
8,16,ross:," okay. okay, i'll talk to him."
8,16,monica:," all right. now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money. "

8,16,chandler:," i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
8,16,phoebe:," they're just talking, and y'know what? just because i think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen."
8,16,monica:," phoebe, good work."

8,17,ross:," i don't know. i mean i i guess i could. it's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. and if i go over there i'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. "
8,17,phoebe:," oh wait a second you guys 'for the last couple weeks i've been that guy everywhere i go. we take the same bus. we go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy. "

8,17,rachel:, oh my god!! you guys have such problems!! i feel so terrible for you!

8,18,phoebe:, are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
8,18,joey:," i guess it could've been, i didn't really look at it. y'know, i just wiped it on chandler's coat and got the hell out of there."
8,18,phoebe:, he's just such a great guy i'm so excited about him.
8,18,joey:," oh hey, you should be excited about him. there's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy. "
8,18,phoebe:, you think?
8,18,joey:, yeah. ya know what i think; i think we were all just being too negative.
8,18,phoebe:," you're right. you're right, he's just embracing life. we could all stand to be a little more like parker. you know what? i am like him! i'm a sunny, positive person. "

8,18,parker:, that sounds great. my god this is the most comfortable couch i've ever sat on in my entire life. 
8,18,phoebe:," let's try something else, let's play a game."
8,18,parker:, i love games!

8,18,parker:," i lose, now jenga."
8,18,phoebe:, oh my god! oh my god! 
8,18,parker:, is something wrong?
8,18,phoebe:," wrong? really? you know the word wrong. everything isn't perfect? everything isn't magical? everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? they were just brake lights, parker! "
8,18,parker:," well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!"
8,18,phoebe:, you don't have to put a good spin on everything.
8,18,parker:, i'm sorry that's who i am. i'm a positive person.
8,18,phoebe:," no! i am a positive person. you are like santa clause on prozac, at disneyland, getting laid! "
8,18,parker:," so what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?"
8,18,phoebe:, much less happy!
8,18,parker:," fine! well then to quote ross, ""i'd better be going."" "
8,18,phoebe:, so long! don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! 
8,18,parker:, isn't this the most incredible fight you've ever had in your entire life? 
8,18,phoebe:, uh huh. 
8,18,ross:," 'and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!"
8,18,rachel:," ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible."
8,18,ross:, but having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
8,18,rachel:, it was really fun being married to you tonight. 
8,18,ross:," yeah! and! and, it was the easiest 400 bucks i've ever made."
8,18,rachel:," okay ross, can i uh, can i ask you something?"
8,18,ross:, yeah.

8,18,ross:," i know, i know it was stupid. "
8,18,rachel:," are you kidding?! with the, with the lilies, and and the song, and the stars! it was 'really wonderful! did you just make that up? "
8,18,ross:," no, actually i thought about it when, when we were going out. it's how i imagined i uh, i would ask you to marry me. "
8,18,rachel:," well, that would've been very hard to say no too. "
8,18,ross:," it's a good thing i didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. okay, good night"
8,18,rachel:, goodnight 
8,18,ross:, even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up? 
8,18,rachel:, i will think about it. 
8,18,ross:, that's all i'm askin' ending credits 
8,18,monica:," okay that's it. i give up. at mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech. "
8,18,ross:, y'know i don't understand why they didn't cry. it was a beautiful speech. 
8,18,monica:," oh, come on. "
8,18,ross:," hey! all that stuff you said about true love, you were right, i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad! and that picture of chi chi with her mischievous grin. and what you said about nana. ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. and you know what? i think she was. "

8,19,joey:," no. they really like me over there. they want to do a big profile on me, but i said no."
8,19,ross:, why'd you say no?
8,19,joey:," remember what happened the last time i did an interview for them? i said i write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. so who knows what i might say this time."
8,19,chandler:, if only there was something in your head to control the things you say. 
8,19,rachel:," oh, come on joey! you will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! and you deserve that! and if you do the interview you can mention, oh i don't know, gal pal rachel green?"

8,19,monica:, you think we're being obvious?
8,19,chandler:, y'know i think its great you wanted to meet here. y'know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
8,19,joey:," actually, i didn't know the magazine was paying for it. wouldn't have mattered, i'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food."
8,19,gunther:," umm, i'll have a cup of coffee."

8,20,chandler:, higher or lower than what?
8,20,joey:, this is embarrassing. 
8,20,chandler:, can you believe how lame this is?
8,20,ross:," i'm sorry, i don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other. "
8,20,phoebe:," oh, i told the stripper to be here at five. that's good right?"
8,20,monica:, you ordered a stripper for the shower?! that is totally inappropriate!
8,20,phoebe:, what? he's gonna be dressed as a baby! oh hi mrs. green!
8,20,monica:, hi!
8,20,phoebe:, i'm so glad you could make it.

8,20,monica:, she's still mad.
8,20,phoebe:, yeah i know. isn't it great? one less person we have to make small talk with.
8,20,monica:," phoebe, sandra's mad at you too. it it doesn't bother you?"
8,20,phoebe:," no look, we've apologized twice! i can't do anymore than that. i know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it."
8,20,monica:," look at that face! just like when you were in high school! if i didn't know better i'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. come on, let's get some tea."
8,20,rachel:," oh my look at that. only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? now i don't want you to use your housekeeper ''cause it would just split her focus."
8,20,rachel:," it's like you're a cave person. rachel, you must get a nanny. you don't know how overwhelming this is going to be. i mean when you were a baby i had full time help, i had mrs. kay."
8,20,rachel:, such a sweet woman.
8,20,rachel:, oh rachel!
8,20,rachel:, i just had the greatest idea! i'm gonna come live with you!
8,20,rachel:," oh, i'm so happy i'm gonna do this for my little girl. aw, look at you. you have tears in your eyes."
8,20,rachel:, yes. yes i do. 
8,20,joey:," all right ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the wheel of mayhem?"
8,20,ross:," the wheel has not been my friend tonight joey. uh, i'll take another question. "
8,20,joey:," okay, this is gonna be tough. hold your breath."
8,20,ross:," it's okay, i'm ready."
8,20,joey:," no dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question."
8,20,chandler:," this is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath ' "
8,20,joey:," okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, tris 'holy cow, that's a big word. trisc ' seriously look at this thing. chandler, how do you say that?"

8,20,chandler:, triscadecaphobia.
8,20,ross:, the fear of triscuts! 
8,20,joey:," no! no, fear of the number 13."
8,20,chandler:, fear of triscuts?
8,20,ross:," it's possible, they have really sharp edges."
8,20,joey:," all right chandler, you're up."
8,20,ross:," wait a minute, i i believe i'm entitled to use my angel pass for a free turn?"
8,20,chandler:, this game makes no sense!
8,20,ross:, y'know what? you're just upset because you're losing.
8,20,chandler:," oh come on ross, i think we're all losers here."
8,20,joey:," all right. chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a google card."
8,20,chandler:, let me think. let me thinkoh! i don't care.
8,20,joey:, you you must choose mr. bing.
8,20,chandler:," either, it makes no difference."
8,20,joey:," choose, you jackass!"
8,20,chandler:, i'll take a card.
8,20,joey:," okay, you picked the gimmie card! you get all of ross's points!"
8,20,ross:, what?!
8,20,chandler:, this game is kinda fun.
8,20,ross:, you don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just ''cause you '
8,20,chandler:, i don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other. 
8,20,rachel:, why did you invite my mother?!
8,20,monica:, what?
8,20,rachel:, she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby.
8,20,phoebe:, for how long?
8,20,rachel:," eight weeks. i mean i love my mother, but my god, a long lunch with her is taxing."
8,20,monica:, i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
8,20,phoebe:, she can't hear you.
8,20,rachel:," what? you guys, come on! what am i going to do?"
8,20,phoebe:," well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her."
8,20,rachel:," you're right. you're right. i mean i'm about to have a baby, i can tell my mother that i don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! oh my god! she's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. this cannot happen!"
8,20,monica:," that's right. that is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. do not take no for an answer!"
8,20,rachel:, okay. 
8,20,monica:, this is great! now she's gonna be mad at rachel! y'know what? and i'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
8,20,phoebe:, i have new respect for chandler. all right everybody! it's time to open the presents!
8,20,monica:," well uh, i don't have a gift because i wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention."
8,20,phoebe:," how about you less important people, let's open your presents! "
8,20,rachel:," well, i kinda did. me. eight weeks of me."
8,20,rachel:," sweetheart i know you're gonna be terrific mom, i just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning."
8,20,rachel:, really? remember twinkles?

8,20,phoebe:, oh look.

8,20,woman:, no! it's where you put the dirty ones!
8,20,rachel:, oh you're gonna do that ten times a day?
8,20,rachel:," no dear, that's what babies do."
8,20,monica:," plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?"
8,20,rachel:, you can't leave a baby alone!
8,20,rachel:," oh come of course i know that. i mean of course you never leave a baby alone! i mean who wouldshe wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. oh god, okay. y'know what? i think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. so i think umm, i'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. and for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful."
8,20,woman:, it's actually a bassinet. 
8,20,rachel:," okay mommy, don't ever leave me. commercial break "

8,22,joey:, you said you didn't want to go.
8,22,rachel:, i don't. but i would still like to be acknowledged. what? just because i'm pregnant you think i'm invisible.
8,22,joey:, definitely not invisible.
8,22,monica:," well, well ross didn't care enough to be here, so i think he's out. you snooze you lose."
8,22,chandler:," he's not snoozing, he's teaching a class."
8,22,monica:," well then somebody's snoozing. joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, i was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. "
8,22,chandler:, i haven't seen this dress.
8,22,monica:, star in a movie.
8,22,phoebe:," joey, you pick who ever you want. okay? you just listen to your heart. what does it tell you? phoebe, phoebe."
8,22,joey:, well uh 'i think i want to take chandler.
8,22,phoebe:, phoebe phoebe phoebe phoebeburrrrr! 
8,22,chandler:, you really want to take me?
8,22,joey:," yeah! yeah! i mean i'm sorry, i wish i can take everybody, but y'know chandler always supported my career. he's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back."
8,22,chandler:, so you're never actually going to pay me back?
8,22,monica:," wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? joey, i don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!"
8,22,joey:," it's not just the stuff he paid for, i mean it's it's everything. y'know? he read lines with me. he he went with me on auditions when i was really nervous, and then he consoled me after i didn't get parts that i really wanted. you always believed in me man. even, even when i didn't believe in myself."
8,22,chandler:, i always knew you were gonna make it. i'm so proud of you.
8,22,joey:, thanks. that means a lot to me. 
8,22,phoebe:," mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress."
8,22,joey:, i'm gonna go shave. 
8,22,chandler:," yeah well, i'm gonna go spit. "
8,22,rachel:," oh, i have to pee. if i don't come out in five minutes it's because i've choked to death on the potpourri stink. "
8,22,phoebe:," when she comes out, you hold her nose, i'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her."
8,22,monica:," she's over a week late! she gotta have it today, right?"
8,22,phoebe:, i don't know. i i think it's still gonna be a while.
8,22,monica:," hmm, care to make it interesting? i'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow."
8,22,phoebe:, you're on!
8,22,monica:," okay, how much?"
8,22,phoebe:, one hundred thousand dollars!
8,22,monica:, how about fifty bucks?
8,22,phoebe:, fine! i'll call zurich and move some money around.
8,22,rachel:," all right, who's turn is it to help me get up! "
8,22,phoebe:, no one's here! oh damnit! 
8,22,chandler:, this is so exciting! it's so glamorous! people taking our picture. how do i look?
8,22,joey:, a little tall.
8,22,chandler:, what?
8,22,joey:," do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that i look taller? there you go. "
8,22,chandler:, it's just so glamorous. 
8,22,phoebe:," oh hey mon? rach is here! ohh, you're still pregnant. oh, i'm sorry. i know how uncomfortable you are. y'know what? you look great. yeah, like fifty bucks."
8,22,rachel:," oh, i have to go pee. apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. "
8,22,monica:, damnit! damnit!! here's your fifty bucks! 
8,22,phoebe:," it's interesting that you lost. now, i forget, do you like to lose?"
8,22,monica:, now stop it! double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
8,22,phoebe:, fine! you're on!
8,22,monica:, okay.
8,22,phoebe:," until then, general grant, why don't you set up camp right there."
8,22,ross:, hey is rachel here? we have a doctor's appointment.
8,22,monica:, she's in the bathroom.
8,22,ross:," rach, we gotta go."
8,22,rachel:, in a minute!!!
8,22,ross:," people ask me why we're not together, i just don't know what to tell them."
8,22,rachel:," all right, all right. let's go!"
8,22,ross:," uh, do you wanna go change first? the doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry '"
8,22,rachel:," no, i'm fine."
8,22,ross:, really? you don't think that's a little inappropriate. 
8,22,phoebe:, good god man don't anger it.
8,22,rachel:," ross, it is 100 degrees outside. for the first time in weeks, i am somewhat comfortable."
8,22,ross:, fine! fine! y'know what? whatever you want. okay? you're the mommy.
8,22,rachel:, oh uh uh pal! don't call me mommy! it's bad enough you call your own mother that. 
8,22,monica:, i'm actually with her on this one. 
8,22,joey:," ""i thought i knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."" "
8,22,joey:," okay, this is it. it's my big fight scene coming up. "
8,22,rachel:, ross.
8,22,ross:, yeah?
8,22,rachel:, can i ask you something?
8,22,ross:, uh huh.
8,22,rachel:, when carol was pregnant with ben '
8,22,ross:, mmm?
8,22,rachel:, 'were you this irritating?
8,22,ross:, wow!
8,22,rachel:, excuse me?!
8,22,ross:," oh nothing. nothing! just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. i'm not trying to irritate you."
8,22,rachel:, well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
8,22,ross:," y'know what? the doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then."
8,22,rachel:," okay. seriously, breathe louder ross! that's great!"
8,22,ross:, y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil! 
8,22,rachel:," hi dr. long, how are you?"
8,22,ross:," oh, you're nice to her."
8,22,rachel:, we'll do a quick check.
8,22,rachel:," so, eight days late huh?"
8,22,rachel:, you must be a little uncomfortable.
8,22,rachel:," you're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. it still could last a little while longer. if you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along."
8,22,ross:," actually, they're things you can do. just some home remedies, but in my experience i've found that some of them are quite effective."
8,22,rachel:," okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink."
8,22,rachel:," you can take some caster oil, there's eating spicy foods '"
8,22,rachel:, sex. 
8,22,ross:, you've got to be kidding me! commercial break 
8,22,chandler:, good job joe! well done! top notch!
8,22,joey:, you liked it? you really liked it?
8,22,chandler:," oh ho ho, yeah!"
8,22,joey:, which part exactly?
8,22,chandler:, the whole thing! can we go?
8,22,joey:," oh no no no, give me some specifics."
8,22,chandler:," i love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
8,22,joey:," hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? did did you like that part?"
8,22,chandler:, i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic.
8,22,joey:, you fell asleep!! there was no kangaroo! they didn't take any of my suggestions! that's for coming buddy. i'll see you later. 
8,22,chandler:," don't go! i'm sorry. i'm so sorry! look! this guy fell asleep! he fell asleep too! be mad at him! or, call an ambulance. "
8,22,monica:, hey!
8,22,ross:, hey.
8,22,rachel:, hi!
8,22,monica:, what did the doctor say? any news on when the baby will come?
8,22,rachel:, no. but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
8,22,ross:," yeah, we tried them all. we went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked."
8,22,rachel:," well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, ""that will open up a can of worms."""
8,22,monica:," well what is it? what is it? if it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. i mean, i think you should do it."
8,22,ross:, it's sex.
8,22,monica:, do it!
8,22,ross:, monica!
8,22,monica:," i'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. i mean, women have needs. do it, get yours!"
8,22,phoebe:," oh i i don't know about that. no, i think that if the two of you had sex the the the repercussions would be catastrophic. "
8,22,monica:," all right, let's be practical, if ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. you can borrow chandlerchandler is good!"
8,22,ross:," monica, what is the matter with you?"
8,22,monica:, nothing. i just want the baby to be born today.
8,22,rachel:, why? why today?
8,22,monica:, okay fine! i keep betting phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and i don't want to lose again!
8,22,ross:," what?! while she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! you're betting on your friend staying in this misery?! "
8,22,rachel:, i'll take that bet.
8,22,ross:, what?!
8,22,rachel:," well, i'm miserable here! i might as well make some money out it!"
8,22,ross:, can i get some of that action?
8,22,monica:, wait a minute! now i'm betting against all three of you?
8,22,rachel:," oh honey, don't worry. i really do feel like tomorrow's the day."

8,22,chandler:, what?!
8,22,joey:," give me a number, i don't want to owe you anything!"

8,22,rachel:," oh come on ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! we know what's gonna work! it's doctor recommended!"
8,22,ross:," i'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! my god, i'm dying."
8,22,rachel:," oh come on ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy."
8,22,ross:," this is insane, i'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor."
8,22,rachel:, make love? what are you a girl?
8,22,ross:, always a great way to get in a man's pants.
8,22,rachel:," but you will, you will be performing a service. okay? just just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out."

9,1,joey:," okay well, i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand '"
9,1,chandler:, as we all are at some point during the day.

9,1,chandler:, well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
9,1,joey:," oh, i like that. yeah '"
9,1,chandler:," if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
9,1,joey:, now let's not get carried away. 
9,1,monica:, i want a baby.
9,1,chandler:," honey, we've been over this. i need to be facing the other way."

9,1,rachel:, well 'did you know he was gonna ask me?
9,1,phoebe:, are you kidding? i'm like the one who talked him into it. i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
9,1,rachel:, and you really think this is a good idea?
9,1,phoebe:," i just talked him into it, don't tell me i have to do you too. the puppet master gets tired people."
9,1,rachel:, i just don't know! it just doesn't feel right.
9,1,phoebe:," why?! you two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so."

9,1,nurse:," it's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don't worry. it'll happen."
9,1,joey:, yowsa! 
9,1,rachel:," okay sweetie, you can do it. just open up and put it in your mouth."
9,1,joey:, dear lord.

9,1,rachel:," oh look, she's pulling away again! do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? she looks scared. doesn't she look scared?"
9,1,joey:," y'know, i don't really know her."
9,1,nurse:, why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. 
9,1,joey:, are you kidding me?!
9,1,rachel:, it's just so frustrating! why doesn't she want my breast?!
9,1,joey:, i don't know! maybe she's crazy! 
9,1,phoebe:, oh hey! wait up!
9,1,ross:, hi!
9,1,phoebe:, congratulations! i didn't want to say anything in front of joey ''cause i didn't know if he knew yet.
9,1,ross:," what, that we had a baby? come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier."
9,1,phoebe:," no! no, that you and rachel are engaged!"
9,1,ross:, what?
9,1,phoebe:," oh, it's a secret. oh goodie! yes! we haven't done the secret thing in a long time."
9,1,ross:," phoebe, there is no secret. okay? i didn't propose."
9,1,phoebe:, are you lying? is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
9,1,ross:, i am a doctor! y'know what? i'm just gonna go and talk to rachel myself.
9,1,phoebe:," all right, me too. should we wake her up?"
9,1,ross:," no! no, come on let her sleep! she's so exhausted."
9,1,phoebe:, and so engaged. 
9,1,ross:, what? oh my god! she she thinks we're engaged! why? why? why would she think we're engaged?!
9,1,phoebe:, perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? y'know ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
9,1,ross:, i didn't give her that ring!
9,1,phoebe:, really?
9,1,ross:, no!
9,1,phoebe:, so whose ring is it?
9,1,ross:, it's mine.
9,1,phoebe:, is it an engagement ring?
9,1,ross:, yes!
9,1,phoebe:, but you didn't give it to her?
9,1,ross:, no!
9,1,phoebe:, but you were going to propose?
9,1,ross:, no!!
9,1,phoebe:," huh, i might be losing interest in this."
9,1,ross:," look. look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel, but all i wanted to do is if she maybe 'kinda 'wanted ah 'start 'things up again."
9,1,phoebe:," oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment."
9,1,ross:," look, i didn't want to rush into anything. and it seemed like she didn't want to either. but i don't, i don't understand how any of this happened! what? did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that i was going to propose, throw it on, and and just start telling people?"
9,1,phoebe:," no! no, she said you actually proposed to her."
9,1,ross:, well i didn't! i didn't propose! unless uh ' did i? i haven't slept in forty hours and 'it does sound like something i would do. commercial break 
9,1,chandler:," look, we can't stay in here forever."
9,1,monica:," oh, i still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! he didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!"
9,1,chandler:," this is okay. we're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. "
9,1,monica:, of course. i'll always be your dad.
9,1,chandler:," i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun."
9,1,monica:, it wasn't fun?!
9,1,chandler:," oh, i don't think that. before today i never thought of you two having sex at all. it was a simpler time."
9,1,monica:, what?
9,1,monica:," oh my god! this is so exciting! well, get back in there! i'll guard the door!"
9,1,monica:, whoa whoa whoa! i don't think so! aren't you ovulating?
9,1,monica:," well you gotta get at it princess! when your mother and i were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. that's how i got my bad hip."
9,1,chandler:," this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was '"
9,1,monica:," you're right, you're right. this is about your positions. now, what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good."
9,1,monica:," but pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. you up to the task sailor?"
9,1,chandler:," seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall. "
9,1,monica:, hey.
9,1,rachel:, hey. i need to tell you something.
9,1,monica:," well, now's a good time. i'm on my way to have my ears cut off."

9,1,rachel:," well, i i said yes."
9,1,monica:," what?! are you crazy? you just had ross's baby! it's it's so inappropriate. no, it's worse than that. it's wrong. it's ' it is bigger than mine! "
9,1,rachel:," i know. days of our lives, thank you very much."
9,1,monica:, you can't marry him!
9,1,rachel:, why not? i don't want to do this alone! and he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
9,1,monica:, well do you love him?
9,1,rachel:, sure.
9,1,monica:, sure?
9,1,rachel:," yeah, i mean whatever."
9,1,monica:," honey, the question is 'do you really want to marry joey?"
9,1,rachel:," no. no, i don't. could you be a dear and go tell him? "
9,1,chandler:, you still haven't told rachel you weren't really proposing?
9,1,joey:," no! she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out."
9,1,chandler:," joey, you have to tell her what's going on! and what did it look like?!"
9,1,joey:, i didn't look at it. stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
9,1,chandler:, go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out.
9,1,joey:," look, it's not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me. i don't want to hurt her."
9,1,chandler:," okay, look, just do it gently."
9,1,joey:," you're right. you're right. i i'll go tell her now before ross finds out and i'll be gentle. i can do that. i am a gentle person. oh, by the way. two people screwing in there if you want to check that out. "

9,1,ross:," poor baby, you're so tired. rach, i didn't propose to you, joey didn't propose to you, and chandler didn't propose to you."
9,1,rachel:," uh ' you didn't propose to me, chandler didn't propose to me, but joey did. "

9,3,monica:, excuse me?
9,3,chandler:, i know what she's talking about.
9,3,rachel:," we've got to find a new pediatrician. ross was getting sick last night, and i think emma may have caught it."
9,3,monica:, why don't you go see dr. gettleman? 
9,3,rachel:, ross said he died. 
9,3,monica:," he didn't die. i saw his daughter last week. said he was fine. her on the other hand, botched botox."
9,3,rachel:," oh, great! well, then i'm gonna take emma to see him. i wonder why ross said that he died."
9,3,monica:," oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist."
9,3,chandler:, he saw a therapist?
9,3,monica:," yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out."
9,3,rachel:, why? what was it?
9,3,monica:, that i was going to eat him. 
9,3,joey:, mike!!!
9,3,mike:, yeah? 
9,3,joey:, okay! 
9,3,mike:," i gotta tell you, i can't believe i'm doing this with you. although i did just get out of a nine year relationship, so i guess i should be open and taking some risks."
9,3,joey:," everything is gonna be fine. just follow my lead, okay? all you have to do is pretend to be mike."
9,3,mike:, i am mike.
9,3,joey:, atta boy! 
9,3,joey:," okay, look..."

9,3,phoebe:," wow, you guys go way back then. so what are you up to these days?"
9,3,mike:," well, i'm a lawyer."
9,3,joey:," mike, 'attorney at law'!"
9,3,mike:," actually, i just gave up my practice."
9,3,joey:, what? that's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
9,3,mike:," i always wanted to play piano professionally, and i figured if i don't do this now, i never will."
9,3,phoebe:," wow, that's great! i liked that better than the law thing, so..."
9,3,joey:, i thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
9,3,joey:," no, no, that's not what i meant. let's get you a cocktail. "

9,3,monica:," nothing, huh?"
9,3,chandler:," no, 'slim pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. they're looking for a cook. actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. they're looking for someone to shovel mesquite. "
9,3,monica:, 'slim pickings'...that is so cheesy.
9,3,chandler:, 'so cheesy' also has an opening.
9,3,monica:," honey, that's okay. i actually know this woman, nancy, who's a restaurant biz head hunter. maybe she'll know of something."
9,3,chandler:, can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me. when we get to tulsa i'm taking you for a great dinner at 'slim pickings'. 'so cheesy'? 'whole hog'? it's going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa.
9,3,monica:," hi, nancy. hi, it's monica geller. i'm good. listen, i'm looking for a job in tulsa. well yeah, my husband has been relocated...because i love him! no, i don't want a job in new york. javo is looking? oh my god! he asked for me personally? oh my god! oh, wow, this is really flattering, but i'm moving to tulsa. yeah, so if you would tell javo 'i'll take it!'

9,3,chandler:, what?
9,3,monica:," so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, javo . it's just a little outside of tulsa."
9,3,chandler:, how far outside?
9,3,monica:, manhattan.
9,3,chandler:," and you're thinking of taking it? so before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but i guess now it's old job, me, new job. "
9,3,monica:," i'm gonna miss this hand! okay i know it's a lot to ask, but oh my god chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
9,3,chandler:, what happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
9,3,monica:," well, if you really think about it, i mean four days is not that long. i mean, i see you monday before you go to work, and i see you thursday when you get back, and i always work late on tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. and well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend."
9,3,chandler:, i think you should take the job.
9,3,monica:, really?
9,3,chandler:, yeah. i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
9,3,monica:, that's the nicest anyone has ever said to me! 
9,3,ross:, hey!
9,3,monica:, how was the pediatrician?
9,3,rachel:," oh, i really liked him. yeah, it was really, really, really good."
9,3,ross:, you promised you wouldn't say anything.
9,3,rachel:, i know. ross still sees his pediatrician!!! i don't care!
9,3,monica:, are you serious? you still see dr. gettleman?
9,3,ross:, he's a brilliant diagnostician!
9,3,chandler:, diagnostician or boo boo fixer?
9,3,rachel:," ross, seriously! you've gotta go to an appropriate doctor."
9,3,ross:," why? why? i know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? he knows my medical history, and every time i go in there, he makes a big deal. 'ah look, it's my favorite patient!'"
9,3,chandler:, does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
9,3,ross:," hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!"
9,3,chandler:, that was not a security blanket! that was a wall hanging!
9,3,ross:, it didn't spend much time on the wall!!! 
9,3,mike:," excuse me, hi. i was hoping i would run into you. can we talk?"
9,3,phoebe:, sure.
9,3,mike:," i'm sorry, really, i'm so embarrassed. really, i'm a pretty nice guy. just ask my parole officer...apparently i'm not a funny guy."
9,3,phoebe:, why did you go along with that?
9,3,mike:," because i was told i'd get a free dinner, which i didn't. and that i'd meet a pretty girl. which i did."
9,3,phoebe:," that's true. well, is anything you told me about yourself true?"
9,3,mike:," my name in mike, and i do play piano."
9,3,phoebe:, prove it.
9,3,mike:, there isn't a piano here.
9,3,phoebe:, that wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
9,3,mike:, 
9,3,phoebe:, you are really good! i play a little guitar myself.
9,3,mike:, really?
9,3,phoebe:, uhuh.
9,3,mike:, that's great. what kind of music do you play?
9,3,phoebe:," well, like acoustic folksy stuff. you know? but right now i'm working on a couple 'iron maiden' covers. "
9,3,mike:," do you think that maybe, sometime, i could..."
9,3,phoebe:," it's okay. go ahead, ask me out."
9,3,mike:, okay. do you think maybe sometime i could take you out?
9,3,joey:, 
9,3,phoebe:," oh, you just caught me off guard! yeah, that would be nice."
9,3,joey:, look at this. my two best friends! 
9,3,ross:," excuse me, i don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me."

9,3,sally:," it's hard isn't it? there's almost no time for a social life. i mean, where are you gonna meet someone?"
9,3,ross:," well, let's say, i don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office."
9,3,nurse:," rossy, we're ready for you."
9,3,ross:," hmm, yeah. come on ross jr. it's time to go in."

9,4,joey:, hey! i never have an off night ok although sometimes when i'm a little bloated i don't feel very sexy but even then i'm better then most!
9,4,monica:, honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
9,4,rachel:," yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other."

9,4,phoebe:, what!
9,4,ross:, umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum.
9,4,phoebe:, what! why?
9,4,ross:, well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
9,4,phoebe:, if you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!
9,4,ross:," well phoebe, i think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer and he used to date oprah. "
9,4,phoebe:," i'm not going along with some lie you made ross, no i'm just gonna be honest with him."
9,4,ross:, good yeah just be honest with him.
9,4,phoebe:, yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so i'll just be alone forever you know alright i'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. i'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh 
9,4,ross:, i'll get it
9,4,phoebe:, ok
9,4,mike:," you know i'm trying to think of the last time i opened a door and you weren't there, phoebe are you ok? "
9,4,phoebe:," so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, i kinda took it the hardest cause i was the youngest."
9,4,joey:, what?
9,4,joey:, what! when?
9,4,joey:," i really, really think i would remember sleeping with you"
9,4,joey:, no it's not ringing any bells.

9,4,joey:," ooooooooooh, i slept with you! and you obviously remember me hey! i still got it. so were good. i'll let myself out. "
9,4,phoebe:," .and i said vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel."
9,4,mike:, but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross
9,4,phoebe:, yeah well yeah you know emma's birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee.
9,4,mike:, that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
9,4,phoebe:, i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
9,4,mike:," i just think there's somebody better out there for you, i mean i'm not saying me but. maybe me."
9,4,phoebe:, oh.
9,4,mike:," and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although i do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway i just think i can make you happy."
9,4,phoebe:, ok i can't do this.
9,4,mike:, what's wrong?
9,4,phoebe:," well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because i never really have been in a long term relationship, i've never lived with a guy, and i've never even celebrated an anniversary so. if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand. in fact i'll close my eye's make it less awkward you kissed me."
9,4,mike:, uh huh
9,4,phoebe:, so you don't think i'm a total freak
9,4,mike:, no. well look can i think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
9,4,phoebe:," i guess so, can i. can i think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers."
9,4,mike:, definitely
9,4,ross:, this is vicrum.

9,4,chandler:, no i'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
9,4,monica:," oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. or does it always have to be sharks?"
9,4,chandler:, does what always have to be sharks.
9,4,monica:," honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash."

9,4,chandler:," you are an amazing wife. no really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, i mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that."
9,4,monica:," im very, very drunk right now. "
9,4,joey:," you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious."
9,4,joey:, your right! i love my life! i actually did sleep with

9,5,phoebe:," oh, rachel!"

9,6,phoebe:," uhuh... yeah...!, you know. and given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am."
9,6,monica:, what are you gonna do?
9,6,phoebe:," i mean i guess, i just have to... tell david that nothing can happen between us. unless i don't... you know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
9,6,monica:, you have to tell david!
9,6,phoebe:," okay, i knew i should have had this conversation with joey. "
9,6,chandler:," funniest guy she's ever met! i'm funny, right...? what do you know, you're a door... you just like knock knock jokes... save it for inside! "
9,6,monica:, heeeeeey! 
9,6,chandler:, hey!
9,6,phoebe:, hey!
9,6,chandler:," so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they call it the sooner state. frankly i'd sooner be in any other state. and what's with oklahoma having a pan handle? can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, i'm from the waistband, wyoming. but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
9,6,monica:, was your cabin pressurised?
9,6,chandler:, and don't get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk.
9,6,phoebe:, okay. 
9,6,chandler:," what's with the word y'all? you know, just... two words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so, i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, i'll have the fricken? see, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
9,6,monica:," no, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. i told you about that funny guy, geoffrey, right?"
9,6,chandler:," yeah, he came up..."
9,6,monica:," well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there, but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. "
9,6,chandler:, were you there?
9,6,phoebe:," no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny... "
9,6,sandy:," i really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. i mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... "
9,6,rachel:," sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
9,6,ross:, are you gay? 
9,6,rachel:, ross!
9,6,sandy:, it's okay. i get that a lot doing what i do. but i am straight. i i'm engaged actually.
9,6,rachel:, oh!
9,6,sandy:, her name is deliah.
9,6,rachel:," oh, that's pretty."
9,6,ross:, so you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
9,6,sandy:," i realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but i really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child."
9,6,ross:, okay.
9,6,sandy:, skdandy... that was his name for me... i'll see you every day... right in... 
9,6,ross:," yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. "
9,6,rachel:," oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
9,6,sandy:," oh, oh, i can do it for her, if you want..."
9,6,rachel:," oh, that would be great! i love him, i love him, i love him..."
9,6,ross:," oh, come on, rach, he's a guy!"
9,6,rachel:," so wh..? he's smart, he's qualified. give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out."
9,6,ross:," because, it's weird!"
9,6,rachel:, why?
9,6,ross:, what kind of job is that for a man? a nanny? i it's like if a woman wanted to be...
9,6,rachel:, yes?
9,6,ross:, king?
9,6,sandy:, i er... i hope you don't mind. i used some of my home made lotion on emma. it's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. it'll dry that rash right up. plus... it keeps the hands young... 
9,6,rachel:, please? yes! sandy you're hired.
9,6,sandy:, that's great! i'm sorry. it's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
9,6,rachel:, oooh... ***i really can't hear what she says*** come here.
9,6,ross:, you gotta be at least bi... commercial break 
9,6,chandler:," hey! i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks."
9,6,joey:, ooh. i i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering lines.
9,6,chandler:," well, thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it."
9,6,joey:," i know, right? wh... wh... why are we doing this?"
9,6,chandler:, monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
9,6,joey:, seriously? she actually said that?
9,6,chandler:, yes! am i crazy to be this upset?
9,6,joey:, nooooo! being funny is your thing!
9,6,chandler:, yeah!
9,6,joey:," without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
9,6,chandler:, ye....

9,6,phoebe:," oh, wait, wait!"
9,6,david:," yeah, i i don't, i can't get away with stuff like that. i i it sounded sexy in my head, so i..."
9,6,phoebe:," no, no, it's not that. uhm... remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no? well, uhm... i am. his ... his name is mike."
9,6,david:, oh... oh...
9,6,phoebe:," yeah, i should have told you."
9,6,david:," no... well, yeah."

9,6,david:," well, i it's okay. i i i understand... well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?"
9,6,phoebe:, i am happy.
9,6,david:," damn it! i i'm sorry. i i don't mean that. i i want you to be happy... but only with me. no, uhm... that's not fair. uh, who cares, leave him!. oh, i don't mean that. yes i do... i'm sorry uhm, i... i think i should probably uhm... go..."
9,6,phoebe:," well... but david, just... i just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things i've ever had to do."
9,6,david:, well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a vladnik carnival either... can we at least hug goodbye?
9,6,phoebe:," of course, yeah. you know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
9,6,david:, no... no...
9,6,phoebe:, i mean... 
9,6,david:, in minsk...
9,6,phoebe:, yeah?
9,6,david:, ...it's uhm... i it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.
9,6,phoebe:," well, if that's what they do in minsk... in new york... it's... "
9,6,rachel:, oh... oh boy... hi...

9,6,rachel:," oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancÃ©e and it was just sooo beautiful."
9,6,sandy:," well, her favourite flower is the camellia. from the poem..."
9,6,rachel:, i can't... i can't hear it again.
9,6,sandy:," you know, i can't tell it again... "
9,6,ross:," and i'm fine never having heard it... rach, can i... can i see you for a sec?"
9,6,rachel:, yeah! excuse me... 
9,6,ross:, do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? huh? i haven't cried that many times since i moved in.
9,6,rachel:," look, ross, he's just... sandy is just sensitive, that's all."

9,6,rachel:, what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby?
9,6,ross:," yeah, i mean, all things that guy... these are amazing!"

9,6,ross:," this... this is exactly what i'm talking about. what kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh? they're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. "
9,6,rachel:," well, i... you know, i i i don't know what to say... i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. you know, 'cause i gotta tell you ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle."
9,6,ross:, hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
9,6,rachel:," okay, what? what is too sensitive? "
9,6,phoebe:," hmmm... no, no... no, i can't do this. it's bad."
9,6,david:," but... i i it's nice... a a and... nice is good. a a and good is not bad, ergo, w w we should keep kissing."
9,6,phoebe:," no, no. no."
9,6,david:, but... ergo...

9,6,ross:, wow!
9,6,joey:, really? do you not know chandler?
9,6,monica:," is that why he's acting so weird...? he's jealous...? oh my god, that is crazy. it's not like i'm attracted to geoffrey..."
9,6,joey:," so what? being funny is chandler's thing... you know, like ross's thing is... "
9,6,ross:, science...? academia...? being a good father...?
9,6,joey:, ...no...

9,6,chandler:, so those were pity laughs? pity laughs? 
9,6,monica:," honey, listen... you have nothing to worry about with geoffrey."
9,6,chandler:, oh yeah? is he funnier than me?
9,6,monica:," well, you're... you're different funny... i mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a a and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks..."
9,6,chandler:," i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
9,6,monica:," honey, you know i think you're hilarious! come on, you know that joke you told me last week? the one about jerry lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? that slayed me."

9,6,ross:," okay, okay... how exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?"
9,6,sandy:, actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... the whimsical characters are just for us. 
9,6,joey:, i wanna be mr. wigglemunch. 
9,6,ross:, oh my god!
9,6,sandy:," well, i guess we know who's gonna be the grumpus... "
9,6,rachel:, that was kind of rude!

9,6,rachel:," you know, he was just doing his job..."
9,6,ross:," well, you know what... i i'm sorry i'm the only one who isn't in love with gary poppins out there... but i just... i can't... i can't go through with this."

9,6,sandy:," oh, no, no, no... that's okay. i got a lot of offers from other families. i just picked you guys because... i liked you the best."
9,6,rachel:," oh, damn you geller!"
9,6,ross:," anyway, uhm...well, i'm glad there's no hard feelings."
9,6,sandy:," no, none at all. you need to be happy with whoever is in your home... although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? maybe it's something i can work on in the future."
9,6,ross:," no, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue."
9,6,sandy:, what is it...? please...? 
9,6,ross:," you know, i'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you."
9,6,sandy:," that's fair... although, can i ask... why do you think that is?"
9,6,ross:, why... i... i don't know. uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
9,6,sandy:, hmmm... 
9,6,ross:," i mean, uhm... you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... you know a a and as a kid i wasn't the athlete i am now."
9,6,rachel:, huh ha ha!
9,6,ross:," i play squash...! anyway, uhm... i uhm... i always get the feeling he thought i was too sensitive."
9,6,sandy:, that must have been hard.
9,6,ross:," it was hard... i remember... i was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""what are you doing with those things? what's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?"
9,6,sandy:, but you are a real boy!
9,6,ross:," i know i am! ...and when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
9,6,sandy:, it's allright! crying is good. it lets the boo hoos out. 
9,6,ross:, a friend ship...
9,6,joey:, wow! you blow my mind...
9,6,sandy:," oh, i gotta go."
9,6,joey:, aaahh... how much do i owe you?
9,6,sandy:, twenty bucks.
9,6,joey:, it's like the cheapest college ever.
9,7,ross:," and that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. yes we were! yes we were! come here gorgeous. oh! look at you! you are the cutest little baby ever! you're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? but you've got... you've got big beautiful eyes... yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. big baby butt! i like big butts. i like big butts and i cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get... oh my god, emma... you're laughing! oh my god, you've never done that before, have you? you never done that before... daddy made you laugh, huh? well, daddy and sir mix alot... what? what? you... you wanna hear some more? uhm... my anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon... i'm a terrible father! opening credits "
9,7,chandler:, hi!
9,7,joey:, hey... hey listen... what do you guys know about investments?
9,7,chandler:, how come?
9,7,joey:," well, i'm starting to make good money on the show and i'm thinking... i should probably do something with it."
9,7,monica:, what do you do with your money now?
9,7,joey:," well, i just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. i didn't say that! it's in a bank guarded by robots!"
9,7,chandler:, do you have any ideas?
9,7,joey:," uh, yeah... this guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. that'd be kinda cool huh? pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus..."
9,7,monica:, joe... emus are birds. you raise them for meat.
9,7,joey:," ""excuse me, i'll have a bucket of fried bird."" or... or maybe just a wing or... "
9,7,monica:," joey, i think you should consider something a little less risky. i mean, i think in this market, real estate is your best investment.the fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. that's right, i know some stuff!"
9,7,joey:," real estate, huh? hmmm..."
9,7,monica:," oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? richard!"
9,7,chandler:," oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex boyfriend is shocking? monica!"
9,7,monica:, my dad told me. they play golf together.
9,7,chandler:," oh, well... maybe i'll join them some time. i just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face. "
9,7,phoebe:, hey!
9,7,phoebe:, listen! you have to help me pick a dress 'cause i'm meeting mike's parents tonight! 
9,7,monica:," wow, the boyfriend's parents! that's a big step."
9,7,phoebe:, really? that hadn't occurred to me.
9,7,monica:," they just gonna love you, just be yourself."
9,7,phoebe:, they live on the upper east side on park avenue!
9,7,rachel:," oh yeah, she can't be herself."
9,7,phoebe:," oh god, neither!"
9,7,monica:," i'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. it's gonna be fine."
9,7,rachel:," ""oh mr. pincer, i can see where wallis gets his good looks..."""
9,7,monica:, you went out with wallis pincer?
9,7,rachel:," uh, he took the sat's for me."
9,7,monica:, i knew you didn't get a 1400!
9,7,rachel:," ssshyeah, well, duh! i mean..."
9,7,phoebe:, so... now... what about with mike's mom?
9,7,rachel:," oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. take it from me, moms love me. ross's mom one time actually said i'm like the daughter that she never had."
9,7,monica:, she said what?
9,7,phoebe:, that's she's like the daughter she never had. listen! 
9,7,rachel:, hi.
9,7,ross:, hi.
9,7,rachel:," i just finished getting phoebe all dressed to meet mike's parents. she's so nervous, it's so sweet!"
9,7,ross:, guess what? i made emma laugh today.
9,7,rachel:, you what? and i missed it? because i was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
9,7,ross:," yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. it was... it was like uhm... only... only not creepy."
9,7,rachel:," well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? "
9,7,ross:," i uhm... well, i sang... well actually i rapped... baby got back... "
9,7,rachel:, you what? you sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
9,7,ross:," but you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles."
9,7,rachel:, owwwww...
9,7,ross:, please don't take her away from me! 
9,7,catherine:," oh hi, come on in. i'm catherine, the listing agent."
9,7,joey:, hi i'm joey. this is chandler.
9,7,chandler:, so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt? medical malpractice? choked on his own moustache?
9,7,catherine:," actually, he is buying a much bigger place. it's got a great view of central pa....."
9,7,chandler:, mmm that's enough about you!
9,7,joey:, is there anything we should know about the apartment?
9,7,catherine:," all the appliances are included. there is a lot of light, a new kitchen... i think you guys would be very happy here... "
9,7,chandler:," no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no... we're not together. we're not a couple. we're definately not a couple."
9,7,catherine:," oh... okay, sorry!"
9,7,joey:," well, you seem pretty insulted by that. what? i'm not good enough for you? "
9,7,chandler:," we're not gonna have this conversation again... look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this huge macho couch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man! you don't think he's here, do you? "
9,7,joey:," you know what it is? it's a nice place but i gotta see i don't know if i see myself living here. oh, oh, oh, let me see... yeah, i could see it."
9,7,chandler:," look at these videos. you know, i mean, who does he think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my god!"
9,7,joey:, what?
9,7,chandler:, there's a tape here with monica's name on it.
9,7,joey:, ooh! a tape with a girls name on it. it's probably a sex tape... wait a minute... this says monica... and this is richard's apartment... 
9,7,chandler:, get there faster! 
9,7,mike:, wow! you look like... like my mom.
9,7,phoebe:, i'm wearing pantyhose!

9,7,phoebe:," oh, try and stop me!"
9,7,mike:, hey... wh... what are you doing?
9,7,phoebe:, i'm trying to get your parents to like me.
9,7,mike:," yeah, i'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... i'm wanting them to get to know phoebe, not phoebe..."
9,7,phoebe:, got it! it... it's hard to stop...
9,7,mike:," well, come on..."
9,7,theodore:," phoebe, these are our friends, tom and sue angle."
9,7,bitsy:," phoebe, come sit. tell us a little bit about yourself... so where are you from?"
9,7,phoebe:," uhm... okay, well, allright, uhm... originally i'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... i just moved to the city where uhm... i actually lived in a burned out buick lesabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... i got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but i... i got over it and uhm... anyway, now i'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least i don't pay taxes, huh... so... where does everyone summer? commercial break "
9,7,phoebe:, god! god! this is not going well.
9,7,mike:," no, no, no, you're doing fine, really... why don't you go talk to my dad?"
9,7,phoebe:," okay, okay, okay, okay... still sure about me being myself?"
9,7,mike:, absolutely! or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
9,7,phoebe:, so theodore... i uhm... i can see where mike gets his good looks from...
9,7,theodore:, oh... well...
9,7,phoebe:, yeah... and that physique! you must work out all the time...
9,7,theodore:," oh no, not all the time... i do the best i can..."
9,7,phoebe:, yeah i bet! look out! 
9,7,theodore:, oh! owwwww! 
9,7,phoebe:," oh my god, are you okay?"
9,7,theodore:, i recently had surgery.
9,7,phoebe:, i'm so sorry!
9,7,theodore:," no, i'll be fine... i just should check the stitches..."
9,7,phoebe:," i really, really am sorry."
9,7,theodore:, how could you know. why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach? 
9,7,mike:, uhm... did you just hit my dad?
9,7,phoebe:," yes... i'm sorry, i've never met a boyfriends parents before..."
9,7,mike:," but, i mean, you have met... humans before, right? look, why don't you go talk to my mom?"
9,7,phoebe:," yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... she looks nice, i can talk to her."
9,7,mike:," yeah, you do that, and i go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding. "
9,7,phoebe:," yeah... oh bitsy, hi. uhm... listen i just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight."
9,7,bitsy:," well, not at all..."
9,7,phoebe:, also uhm... i just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
9,7,bitsy:," thank you, i think so too."
9,7,phoebe:," well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. especially to you. because he's very respectful of women."
9,7,bitsy:, is he really?
9,7,phoebe:, are you kidding. he is so considerate of my feelings and... you know i think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
9,7,bitsy:, e e excuse me?
9,7,phoebe:," oh no, no, no, no, no, no. don't get me wrong. no, he's not in like a sissy way. no, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave..."
9,7,bitsy:, that's... my boy. 
9,7,mike:, awesome! 
9,7,chandler:," i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching? well, we know i'm gonna watch it. "
9,7,joey:," hey dude, what's up?"
9,7,chandler:," don't judge me, i'm only human!"
9,7,joey:, did you take that tape?
9,7,chandler:," i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... wouldn't you need to know what was on it?"
9,7,joey:, i don't know. who'm i'm married to?
9,7,chandler:, some girl...!?
9,7,joey:, she hot?
9,7,chandler:, yeah...!?
9,7,joey:, how did she get me to settle down?
9,7,chandler:," allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can't possibly be as bad as what i'm picturing in my head... can it?"
9,7,joey:," if a girl says yes to being taped... she doesn't say no to much else, i tell ya..."
9,7,chandler:, then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
9,7,joey:, what? whoo... what?
9,7,chandler:," just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... please?"
9,7,joey:," all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame... "
9,7,chandler:, why am i hearing cheering?
9,7,joey:," well it's okay, its like... its just a football game."
9,7,chandler:, football? just football?
9,7,joey:," yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing."
9,7,chandler:, it's football... it's just football... this is great! this is the first time i've ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to get a beer... what the... what are you doing?
9,7,joey:, you don't wanna see what i just saw! 
9,7,monica:," what are you guys doing? oh my god, is that richard? "
9,7,rachel:," okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please? please laugh for mommy... not funny huh? oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'cause mommy can rap... my name is mommy and i'm here to say / that all the babies are... oh, i can't rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so much, and i know that you're not gonna tell anybody... i like... big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... yes! yes! yes! yes! oohhhhh! oh! i like big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... oh emma you're laughing! oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. oh you beautiful little weirdo... "
9,7,ross:, hey!
9,7,rachel:," oh you missed it. she was laughing. oh it was amazing. it was amazing. it was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that..."
9,7,ross:," oh i know, isn't it? ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?"
9,7,rachel:," oh! you know, i just... couple of things i tried ... i just sang a little doo... itsy bitsy spider..."
9,7,ross:, you sang baby got back didn't you?
9,7,rachel:, nothing else worked. that girl is all about the ass... 
9,7,phoebe:," ...and then it goes back to the chorus... smelly cat, sme lly ca t / i t's not your fau lt. and that's the end of the song... i realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no one had spoken in seventeen minutes."
9,7,mike:, phoebe writes lots of great songs. wha... what was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
9,7,phoebe:," oh, pervert parade?"
9,7,mike:, no...
9,7,phoebe:," oh, ode to a pubic hair?"
9,7,mike:, stop! 
9,7,phoebe:, oh god! is that veal?
9,7,mike:," mom, i thought i told you... phoebe's a vegetarian."
9,7,bitsy:, oh!
9,7,phoebe:," oh no, no, no, no... that's okay, that's okay... i mean, i'm... i am a vegetarian... except for veal... yeah no, veal i love..."
9,7,mike:, phoebe you don't have to eat...
9,7,phoebe:," kittens, fish babies... you know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... hmmm... yummy hmmm... "
9,7,mike:, so...? what do you think? 
9,7,monica:, so you stole that tape from richard's apartment?
9,7,chandler:, whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star!
9,7,monica:, that tape was never meant to be seen by... joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private. 
9,7,joey:," monica, look... i don't think you and i have any secrets anymore... not ready to joke about it yet, okay, i see you later. "
9,7,monica:, why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
9,7,chandler:," because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches."
9,7,monica:, is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
9,7,chandler:, this is about you and richard. he's clearly not over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
9,7,monica:," isn't that sad? i mean, can you see how pathetic that is? you shouldn't be jealous. you should feel bad for him."
9,7,chandler:," oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache!"
9,7,monica:," chandler, this is not our problem. we've got each other. that's all that matters."
9,7,chandler:," yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air..."
9,7,monica:, cowboy boots? i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! 
9,7,chandler:," oh, good, good. play more, 'cause i wanna see how it ends."
9,7,monica:, that's not me!
9,7,chandler:, what...? that's not you! life is good again! ride 'em cowgirl!
9,7,monica:, that bastard taped over me! 
9,7,chandler:, is that a problem? 
9,7,monica:," i it's just so insulting! big spring for a new blank tape, doctor! "
9,7,theodore:, i can't imagine what he sees in her.
9,7,bitsy:," she actually makes me miss that pill popping ex wife of his. oh, hello dear..."
9,7,mike:," hey, what's going on?"
9,7,bitsy:, we were just chit chatting. how's your friend?
9,7,mike:, a little better.
9,7,bitsy:," by the way, do you know who's moving back into town? tom and sue's daughter jen."
9,7,theodore:," you remember her michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single."
9,7,mike:, i'm not interested.
9,7,bitsy:," oh, please darling, let's be honest. you can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real..."
9,7,mike:," all right, stop! you know, all phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. and maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. and yeah... she's a little different than you are..."
9,7,bitsy:," michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! "
9,7,mike:," so what? i mean if even i can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. and you don't have to like her. you just have to accept the fact that i do. i mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman i love..."
9,7,bitsy:, the woman you what? 
9,7,phoebe:, yeah... the woman you what?
9,7,mike:, the woman i love... i love you... which is probably something i shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and tom and sue...who are by the way the most sinfully boring i've ever met in my life...
9,7,phoebe:, i love you too... 
9,7,mike:, you do?
9,7,phoebe:, yeah...! how great is this...? 
9,7,mike:, wanna get out of here?
9,7,phoebe:, okay.
9,7,mike:," mom, dad, thanks for dinner."
9,7,phoebe:, thirteen bathrooms in this place... i threw up in the coat closet... ta taaa... commercial break 
9,7,ross:," she sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette."
9,7,rachel:, so fellas
9,7,ross:, yeah!
9,7,rachel:, fellas
9,7,ross:, yeah!
9,7,rachel:, has your girlfriend got the butt?
9,7,ross:, hell yeah!
9,7,rachel:, so shake it! 
9,7,ross:, shake it!
9,7,rachel:, shake it! 
9,7,ross:, shake it!
9,7,rachel:, shake that nasty butt...
9,7,ross:, baby got back 
9,7,rachel:," one more time from the top... i like big butts and i cannot lie, you other br... "
9,7,ross:, rachel please! that is so inappropriate!
9,8,monica:," hey hon, could you help me get the plates down?"
9,8,chandler:," yeah. hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?"
9,8,monica:," no, i think we should save our china for something really special. like if the queen of england comes over."
9,8,chandler:," honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint. "
9,8,monica:," what if something gets broken, they're so expensive. "
9,8,chandler:, what is the point of having them if we never use them?
9,8,monica:," ok, but if something gets broken, and then the queen comes over.."
9,8,chandler:, i will explain it to her.
9,8,monica:," <laughs> oh yeah, like i'm going to let you talk to the queen. "
9,8,joey:," next up is a marching band from muskogee, ok."
9,8,chandler:, and heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap days of our lives . <joey's eyes become large and he stands up>
9,8,joey:, oh my god!
9,8,chandler:, aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap days of our lives? 
9,8,joey:, yeah! i totally forgot i'm supposed to be there. i can't believe i forgot. i usually write stuff like this on my arm. <chandler grabs joey's left arm and pushes the sleeve up> <joey looks> oh! stupid long sleeves. 
9,8,chandler:, what are you going to do?
9,8,joey:," i guess i'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why i wasn't there. the producers are going to be so mad at me. they sat us all down yesterday and said ""everyone has to be there at 6 am sharp, that means you tribbiani."" like.. like i was some kind of idiot. "
9,8,chandler:, oh emma. this is going to be your first thanksgiving. what are you thankful for? mommy's bobbies. 
9,8,ross:, hello? rachel? 
9,8,rachel:, amy.
9,8,rachel:, hide my rings. <ross goes into rachel's room>
9,8,rachel:, oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says> amy! happy thanksgiving.
9,8,amy:, do you have a hair straightener? 
9,8,rachel:, um... hi.
9,8,amy:, oh... hi.. <goes to rachel with open arms>
9,8,rachel:, aw. <amy grabs her arms>
9,8,amy:, hair straightener?
9,8,rachel:, i haven't seen you in like.. a year.
9,8,amy:," oh, i know, i know. i've just been crazed."
9,8,rachel:, oh well yeah me too. um.. i had a baby. 
9,8,amy:, i decorated dad's office. 
9,8,rachel:," oh.. yeah? well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing."
9,8,amy:," listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. i really need one. i'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house. <amy bending over fiddling with her purse when emma cries and she hears emma>"
9,8,amy:, oh my god!
9,8,rachel:, mh hmm.. 
9,8,amy:, is this emmett? <pointing to emma>
9,8,rachel:, uh.... its emma.
9,8,amy:, its a girl? <ross comes out of the bedrooms>
9,8,ross:, hey amy. 
9,8,rachel:," oh amy, you remember ross."
9,8,amy:, not really. but you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date.
9,8,ross:, that was me.
9,8,amy:, still me.
9,8,amy:," amy. i'm going to save you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> all me. monica and chandler's apartment. <joey is walking around looking worried. >"
9,8,monica:, careful. <hands chandler a china plate> careful. careful! <chandler is startled and nearly drops the plates.> sorry.
9,8,chandler:," i'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, i'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.. "
9,8,monica:," i know, after you left the store, i chose different ones."
9,8,chandler:, why?
9,8,monica:," well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me."
9,8,chandler:," oh suddenly, flowers are feminine? < phoebe comes in>"
9,8,phoebe:," hey, everybody. happy thanksgiving!"
9,8,joey:, hey happy thanksgiving.. pheebs! <motions her to come over> 
9,8,phoebe:," hey, what's going on joe? "
9,8,joey:, i.. i.. i need a good lie.
9,8,phoebe:," oh okay. how about the whole ""man walking on the moon"" thing. you know? you. you could. you could see the strings people! "
9,8,joey:," no, no, no i need a good lie to explain why i wasn't at a work thing today."
9,8,phoebe:," ooh, honey. you stink at lying. "
9,8,joey:, i do not.
9,8,phoebe:," oh really. okay. let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffee house, i went to the bathroom and when i came back, my muffin was gone who took it?"
9,8,joey:," somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and i said ""hey don't eat that that's phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> he said.. ""joey you stink at lying."" what am i going to do? "
9,8,phoebe:," don't worry, don't worry. we'll come up with a good lie. i'll help you practice it."
9,8,joey:," oh great, that'd be great. thank you. "
9,8,phoebe:," sure, what.. what was the work thing? "
9,8,joey:," uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows phoebe, she looks>"
9,8,phoebe:," ""pick up grandma at the airport""?"
9,8,joey:, oh she's precious. do you ever worry she's going to get your real nose? 
9,8,rachel:, amy! <pause> yes i do.. i really do. <grabs ross' hand for support> <amy's cell phone rings> 
9,8,amy:," hello? yeah, um. hang on one sec. <to ross and rachel> can i take this upstairs? "
9,8,ross:," sure, we don't live there but..."
9,8,amy:, seriously? its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands around motioning 'just these rooms'> <to ross> i thought you were a doctor. 
9,8,rachel:," yeah, no. ross has a phd."
9,8,amy:," ew. <walks into rachel's room, i'm guessing>"
9,8,rachel:, god she is unbelievable.
9,8,ross:," i know, i mean a phd is just as good as an md."
9,8,rachel:, stupid thanksgiving.
9,8,rachel:, what? what happened? 
9,8,amy:," my boyfriend canceled on me. i mean.. i i finally find a real relationship. i mean, someone that i can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. i swear, its almost not worth dating married guys. "
9,8,ross:, don't say that.
9,8,amy:, oh. i was so looking forward to this. it was going to be such a beautiful thanksgiving. we were going to have sushi. 
9,8,rachel:," oh amy, don't cry amy.  um.. ross, could i talk to you in private?"
9,8,ross:," sure, you want to go upstairs? <ross and rachel go in the kitchen>"
9,8,rachel:, um look i was thinking.. if its ok with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving.
9,8,ross:," you know, i think thats a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis."
9,8,rachel:," look i know she's a little tough to take. she has no where else to go, and she's my sister. alright, she's emma's aunt. and i would like them to bond. "
9,8,ross:," ok, fine, but i don't want them bonding to much. i don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job. "
9,8,rachel:," hi, hey."
9,8,rachel:," hey you guys, this is my sister amy.  this is chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon. "
9,8,everyone:, hi.
9,8,amy:, yeah.
9,8,amy:, phoe be.
9,8,amy:, oh. that's a funny noise. <monica and amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret closet>
9,8,joey:," pheebs, i still need some help here"
9,8,phoebe:," oh right, ok um. ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . for example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying. "
9,8,joey:, hey. hey where's the baby?
9,8,rachel:, oh we just put her down for a nap.
9,8,amy:, thank you amy. 
9,8,amy:," no, no, then i would get the baby. i mean you know it would be just like a movie. like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her, then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then i'd get married. "
9,8,phoebe:, thats a great movie. <she claps> <joey nods in agreement>
9,8,amy:," now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. i was thinking about changing her name. i'm just not really a big fan of emily. "
9,8,ross:," emma, ross wants you. "
9,8,phoebe:, why does she keep making that noise? 
9,8,rachel:," honey, i don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to ross or to myself <ross and rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby. "
9,8,amy:, well who would?
9,8,ross:," well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want monica and chandler. "
9,8,chandler:, i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma. 
9,8,monica:," yeah oh my god, i'm so moved. "
9,8,amy:," i don't believe this, hold on a second. you guys die and i don't get your baby? "
9,8,rachel:," see look amy, we're a lot closer to monica and chandler. we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby."
9,8,amy:, connected? i mean.. to what? she's.. she's  a lump. 
9,8,chandler:," you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>"
9,8,amy:, <points to chandler> this guy? seriously? later in the day.
9,8,monica:, woah. woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> woah. 
9,8,monica:," okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches ross' arm> ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt."
9,8,joey:, hey! how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? do you not trust me with a fancy plate? 
9,8,monica:," no, honey, its. thats a special plate.  see its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. "
9,8,joey:, i can't believe i won.
9,8,amy:, its such a slap in the face. i'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
9,8,rachel:, monica is ross' sister. 
9,8,amy:," no, ross' sister was really fat. "
9,8,monica:, that was me. 
9,8,amy:," no, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog. "
9,8,rachel:," okay, listen i know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. i mean, i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this. <monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat off with a knife>"
9,8,monica:," now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun. "
9,8,amy:," okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do i get the baby?"
9,8,chandler:," no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated at this comment> if monica dies then i would get emma, right? <ross and rachel pause and ponder this> "
9,8,rachel:, well actually...
9,8,chandler:, actually what? 
9,8,ross:," well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma would go to my parents. "
9,8,chandler:, what?
9,8,amy:, uh.. who has to die for me to get her? <everyone is looking around and at joey with looks of 'what?' on their faces> commercial break.
9,8,chandler:," no,  that that is not what we're saying."
9,8,joey:, yeah he's lying. he looked down. <joey looks to phoebe and she nods in agreement>
9,8,chandler:, well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! 
9,8,rachel:," honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be a wonderful parent. it's just.. you're more the fun parent. "
9,8,ross:, yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. 
9,8,monica:, no you're all about the fun. 
9,8,chandler:," look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think i'm not capable? "
9,8,ross:," no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together. "
9,8,chandler:, ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up. 
9,8,ross:," sure, monica would have to give her up. "
9,8,joey:," i lie better then that, right?"
9,8,chandler:," so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?"
9,8,phoebe:, there's your movie! <claps> later on. monica opens her front door. chandler is sitting in the hallway. 
9,8,monica:, hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner. 
9,8,chandler:, oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly? 
9,8,monica:, ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about. i mean its not like their so responsible. emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom. 
9,8,chandler:," yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong father figure and i never will be. "
9,8,monica:, no you learn these things. you grow into it.
9,8,chandler:," yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it. "
9,8,monica:, i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts. 
9,8,chandler:," oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""go to your room! you're grounded""? "
9,8,monica:," can you hear me say ""you're grounded""?"
9,8,chandler:, you said that to me last week. 
9,8,monica:, the producer from days left a message on my machine asking why i wasn't at the parade. they said everybody's pissed off at me.. <whiny voice> and they all got to meet santa! 
9,8,phoebe:, it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. you weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency. 
9,8,joey:," oh, i like that, yeah. wasn't at the parade because i had a family emergency."
9,8,phoebe:, oh.. my sister's raccoon.
9,8,phoebe:, no! nothing with a raccoon. 
9,8,joey:," arg... alright, i'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air> monica and chandler come through the front door."
9,8,monica:, oh wait.. what are you doing? 
9,8,joey:, setting the table. 
9,8,phoebe:, yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too. 
9,8,monica:, oh how nice. maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. he goes to chandler.
9,8,ross:," hey dude, you okay? sorry about before."
9,8,chandler:," ucch.  <pauses> uchh <louder this time> in case you hadn't noticed, i'm not talking to you. "
9,8,rachel:, uchh! <much louder and longer then amy's>
9,8,amy:, you know.. this.. this is classic rachel.
9,8,rachel:, yeah.. yeah right.. remember in high school when i died and didn't give you my baby?
9,8,amy:," this might be my one chance to have a baby rachel. i mean, you know that i have been so busy focusing on my carrer. "
9,8,rachel:, what? what carrer? 
9,8,amy:, um.. i'm a decorator. 
9,8,rachel:, ok. you decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. okay! i went to the zoo yesterday and now i'm a koala bear. 
9,8,amy:, why can't you ever be supportive? 
9,8,rachel:, sup.. you want to talk supportive? you didn't even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby. 
9,8,amy:, oh. yeah. well.. you didn't come see me when i was in the hospital when i was getting my lips done. 
9,8,rachel:, i did the first time! oh. oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> and you know what. you want to know why i'm not giving emily to you.
9,8,ross:, oh whose side are you on? <back to amy> i'm not giving you emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child. 
9,8,amy:, how hard could it be? you do it. 
9,8,joey:, ooh oooh.. 
9,8,amy:, do you want to know why you don't want  me to have the baby? 
9,8,rachel:, uh huh.
9,8,amy:, because you don't want me to be happy. you.. you have always been jealous of me. 
9,8,rachel:," jealous of what? of your lack of responsiblity? you, your immaturity? your total disregard of other people's feelings? "
9,8,amy:," uh.. to name a few.  you know.. you know.. you've just always been like this. you just have to have everything. and i couldn't have anything. like in junior high, when you stole timmy from me. i mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me? "
9,8,rachel:, timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
9,8,amy:," oh come on, that was 20 years ago. get over it."
9,8,rachel:," i cannot, i cannot believe that i invited you here today."
9,8,amy:," yeah, well you know what i cannot believe. that my so called sister, gets a 30% discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail."
9,8,rachel:, ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> it's forty five. 
9,8,amy:," too far, amy. too far. "
9,8,rachel:, you take that back.
9,8,amy:, no. 
9,8,rachel:, take it back!
9,8,amy:, no! what are you going to do? make me?
9,8,rachel:," heey man, i work out. <ross nods his head and points at her, in a yes manner> "
9,8,amy:, so do i.
9,8,rachel:, i do pilates. 
9,8,amy:, i do yoga.
9,8,rachel:, bring it on! <amy pushes rachel and monica goes berserk and runs around the table> 
9,8,monica:, put the plates in the boxes!! put the plates in the boxes! 
9,8,rachel:, did you just push me?
9,8,amy:," uh, yeah i think i did. "
9,8,rachel:, frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!! <they go back to fighting and then it really gets on>
9,8,phoebe:, oh my god! shouldn't we stop this?
9,8,joey:, what? are you out of your mind? lets throw some jello on them. <amy starts spitting on rachel's hand and rachel is saying ew and pushes her away> 
9,8,rachel:," ew! gross. <amy runs towards rachel and rachel puts her arm out, hand on amy's head and amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, rachel is moving backwards towards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to the floor> <everyone is shocked and monica faints and ross catches her> "
9,8,chandler:," alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out, but they're very important to monica. i want you to apologize to her right now. "
9,8,amy:, i'm sorry.
9,8,rachel:," mon, i'm so sorry. "
9,8,chandler:, sorry.
9,8,chandler:," by the way, that fight was totally arousing. "
9,8,ross:," dude. well done. you know what? if i die, and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma. "
9,8,chandler:, oh yeah? well thanks. 
9,8,ross:," so, so now do i get joey?"
9,8,chandler:," okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose. <ross ponders that and walks away>"
9,8,rachel:, are you okay mon? 
9,8,monica:, uh huh.. i mean these things happen. its' just a plate. its not like somebody died. 
9,8,phoebe:, thank you. it was so beautiful. <gets up and walks towards the front door> i'm going to go to joeys and get the pies. 
9,8,joey:," actually its not pies, its just pie. "
9,8,monica:, i don't care. <pauses and realizes...> oh my god. i've lost the will to scold. 
9,8,rachel:," look amy, it got a little of control..um.. and i'm sorry. you're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.. "
9,8,amy:, so you're going to give me the baby?
9,8,rachel:, you are not going to regret this. <they hug and rachel has this disgusted look on her face and then emma starts crying> 
9,8,rachel:, she needs changing.
9,8,chandler:," oh no no no.. i'll get her. i'm super compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. i'll be right there emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> well.. what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first. commercial break "
9,8,phoebe:," hey, does monica know about her broken plates yet?"
9,8,chandler:, nope...
9,8,phoebe:," broke them all, huh?"
9,8,chandler:, yep...
9,8,phoebe:, you gonna tell her?
9,8,chandler:," nope... hey... so i'm gonna... put the plates back. you know, i think you were right, i don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time."
9,8,monica:, like only if the queen comes?
9,8,chandler:, maybe not even then. 
9,8,joey:," hey! i did it. i called my producer. i told him i had a family emergency, he totally bought it. thanks for teaching me how to lie pheebs."
9,8,phoebe:, stealing... 
9,8,monica:, bye plates!
9,8,joey:," oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? "
9,8,monica:, what? something happened with the plates?
9,8,joey:, uhm... yeah... this uhm... raccoon came
9,9,chandler:, yep.  that's a lot of cats jo lynn.  single are ya? 
9,9,chandler:, chandler bing.
9,9,joey:, hey.  how come you're answering your own phone?  where's your crazy assistant? 
9,9,chandler:, what's up joe?
9,9,joey:," okay, what have we always wanted to do together?"
9,9,chandler:, braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
9,9,joey:," no, no, no.  when you get home tomorrow night, you and i are going to be at the wizzards knicks game . . .  courtside!"
9,9,chandler:, courtside?  oh my god.
9,9,joey:, yeah.  maybe michael jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
9,9,chandler:, that's so cool.  i'll let monica know. 
9,9,monica:, hello?
9,9,chandler:, joey just called.  he's got courtside knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
9,9,monica:," really?  but tomorrow night is the only night i get off from the restaurant.  if you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week."
9,9,chandler:," but hey, it's courtside.  the cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . .   that's not the way to convince you. "
9,9,monica:," chandler look, i don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""you can't go to the game.  you have to spend time with me.""  so, if you could just realize it on your own . . . "
9,9,chandler:," i know.  you're right.  i want to see you too.  i've just got to figure out a way to tell joey, you know?  he's really looking forward to this."
9,9,monica:, tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.  tell him that having a long distance relationship is really difficult.  tell him that what little time we have is precious.
9,9,chandler:," yeah, ah, ah . . .  i'll think of something. "
9,9,ross:," wow!    wow, you look . . . uh . . .   it's just, ah . . .   that dress . . . uh . . .  "
9,9,rachel:," well, i hope the ends of these sentences are good."
9,9,ross:," well, well, they're good.  it's been a while since i've seen you like this.  you, you clean up good."
9,9,rachel:," oh well, well thank you.    okay, stop.  stop looking at me like that.  the last time that happened, that happened.  "
9,9,ross:," oh right, right.    so, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from emma?"
9,9,rachel:," yeah, yeah.  phoebe and i are going to have so much fun.  and thank you for watching the baby, by the way."
9,9,ross:," oh, it's fine.  actually, i, i invited mike over."
9,9,rachel:, phoebe's mike?
9,9,ross:, yeah.
9,9,rachel:, i didn't know you guys hung out.
9,9,ross:," we don't.  but i thought it would be nice to get to know him.  you know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation."
9,9,rachel:,"  ross and mike's first date.  is that going to be awkward?  i mean, what are you guys going to talk about?"
9,9,ross:," i don't know.  but, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.  he plays piano; i played keyboards in college.  he's been divorced; i have some experience in that area. "
9,9,rachel:, yeah. 
9,9,phoebe:, hi
9,9,rachel:, hey.
9,9,phoebe:, oooh.  girl's night out indeed.
9,9,rachel:," ok.  so now, i think emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything ross . . . "
9,9,ross:," rach, rach, we'll be fine, all right?  you go have fun."
9,9,rachel:, okay.  you too.  and i hope you score.  bye.
9,9,mike:, bye.
9,9,ross:, so . . .  welcome.
9,9,mike:, i got beer.
9,9,ross:, i got bottled breast milk.
9,9,mike:," eh, why don't we start with the beer?"
9,9,ross:," okay.    so, um, phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano."
9,9,mike:, yeah.
9,9,ross:," you know, i, i used to, ah, play keyboards in college."
9,9,mike:, ah?    do you have one here?
9,9,ross:, no.
9,9,mike:, okay.  
9,9,ross:," um . . . ah . . . you know, i'm divorced.  um, phoebe, ah . . . phoebe said you . . . you've been divorced?"
9,9,mike:," yeah.    yeah, i'm sorry.  i don't . . . i don't really like to talk about it."
9,9,ross:, that's okay.  we'll talk about something else.  
9,9,mike:,"  so, you're a paleontologist, right?"
9,9,ross:, yeah.
9,9,mike:, my cousin's a paleontologist.
9,9,ross:,  monica and chandler's apartment.  monica is wearing a sexy negligee.  she pours two glasses of wine as chandler enters with a carry on suitcase.  he sets the case by the door.) 
9,9,monica:, hi.
9,9,chandler:, hey.
9,9,monica:, welcome home.
9,9,chandler:,"   oh well, look at you."
9,9,monica:, yeah.  what do you think?
9,9,chandler:," well, it looks great.  it's just that . . . well, i'm wearing the same thing underneath.  so . . ."
9,9,monica:, oh.
9,9,chandler:, see what i mean . . . 
9,9,joey:, hey!  how come the door's locked?
9,9,monica:, just a second.
9,9,chandler:," no, no, no, no, no.  joey can't know that i'm here."
9,9,monica:, why not?
9,9,chandler:," because i didn't know how to tell him that i couldn't go to the knicks game.  so, i just told him that i had to stay in tulsa."
9,9,monica:," so, you lied to him?"
9,9,chandler:, achhh.  it's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.    except with you.
9,9,joey:, hey!  open the door.  what's going on?  
9,9,joey:, what are you . ..    why are you dressed like that?
9,9,monica:," oh, because, um . . .  well, chandler's going to be home in a couple of days.  so, i thought i would, you know, practice the art of seduction."
9,9,joey:," oh, i thought i heard a man's voice before."
9,9,monica:," oh i was just doing chandler's side of the conversation.  you know, like, ""hi, how do i look?""  ""really sexy.  could i be any more turned on?"""
9,9,joey:," okay.    whoa, whoa.  why are there two glasses of wine out?"
9,9,monica:, because. . .  one of them is for you. 
9,9,monica:," cheers.    okay, buh bye.  "
9,9,chandler:," you know, it's funny.  i've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.    hi ya."
9,9,monica:, you might want to keep practicing.
9,9,chandler:, yah. 
9,9,chandler:, it's joey.    hey joe.
9,9,joey:," dude, come home!"
9,9,chandler:, what? why?
9,9,joey:, come . . .  home.
9,9,chandler:," look i, i can't.  what's going on?"
9,9,joey:," i don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . i think monica's cheatin' on ya.  i told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you. "
9,9,joey:," all right look.    if you can't come home and deal with this, then i'm gonna."
9,9,chandler:, no!
9,9,joey:, i just heard him!
9,9,chandler:, can you . . . hear him . . . now?
9,9,joey:,"   no.  all right, i'm going in."
9,9,chandler:, no! wait!
9,9,joey:, i heard him again!
9,9,chandler:," all right, look.  just stay there.  i'm coming home."
9,9,joey:, okay.  great.  i'll see you when you get here.  i'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
9,9,chandler:, is that really necessary?
9,9,joey:, ross and rachel's apartment.  mike is blowing a note from his beer bottle.  ross stares off to the side.)
9,9,ross:," shouldn't the pizza be here by now?  i mean, they said thirty minutes or less.  well, how long has it been?"
9,9,mike:," eleven minutes.    and now twelve.  so, do you like the beer?"
9,9,ross:," i do.  i do.  although, it's actually a lager."
9,9,mike:, huh.    what's the difference between beer and lager?
9,9,ross:, i don't know.  we could look it up.
9,9,mike:, things are about to get wild. 
9,9,phoebe:, oh god.  remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and ross?
9,9,rachel:, oh god.  it seems like forever ago.
9,9,phoebe:," i know.     so, what's going on with you and ross?"
9,9,rachel:," well, um . . . i don't know.  i mean, for a long time nothing.  but you know, actually right before you picked me up, ross and i had a . . . ah . . . little thing."
9,9,phoebe:, oh my god!  i love things.  what happened?
9,9,rachel:," well, um, first he told me he liked how i looked.  and, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye contact."
9,9,phoebe:, eye contact?
9,9,rachel:, mm hmm.
9,9,phoebe:, i hope you were using protection.
9,9,waiter:,"   excuse me.  um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar."
9,9,rachel:, oh.  should we send them something back?
9,9,phoebe:, oooh.  let's do.  let's send them mashed potatoes.
9,9,rachel:," no!  wait!  no, no.  don't do that!  that's going to make them think they can come over here."
9,9,phoebe:, so?  what if they do?
9,9,rachel:," well, we're not here to meet guys.  you have a boyfriend, i have a b. . . baby and a ross."
9,9,phoebe:," yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.  we're just having fun.  you know, not everything had to go as far as ""eye contact."" "
9,9,monica:," chandler, you have to tell joey that you're not in tulsa."
9,9,chandler:," don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that i'm cheating on him?    i heard it."
9,9,monica:, i don't want him to think that i'm having an affair.
9,9,chandler:, all right.  i've got a plan.  i'll go down the fire escape.
9,9,monica:," yes, because all good plans start with, ""i'll go down the fire escape."""
9,9,chandler:," hear me out woman.  i'll go down the fire escape.  then, i'll wait for a while.  then, when i come up the stairs, it'll be just like i just got back from tulsa.  then, joey and i will come in and see that there's no guy in here."
9,9,monica:, aren't you afraid that joey's going to figure all of this out?    i heard it. 
9,9,chandler:, i'm just going to wait for a little while.
9,9,monica:, scary pigeon's back?
9,9,chandler:, it's huge. 
9,9,rachel:, oh my god.  i can't believe you live in that building.  my grandmother lives in that building.  ida green?  no sense of personal space?  kind of smells like chicken?  looks like a potato.
9,9,bill:," ""spuds"" is your grandmother?"
9,9,rachel:, that's my bubby!
9,9,kevin:," so, we're on our way to a couple of parties.  um. . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun."
9,9,phoebe:," bye. wow. so, that's great. you, bill, ross, and emma are going to be so happy together. what were you thinking?"
9,9,rachel:," i don't know.  he was cute, and he liked me.  it was an impulse."
9,9,phoebe:, what about ross?  what about your moment?  don't you want to talk to ross about it?
9,9,rachel:," no.  no, because i know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.  ""hey ross, you know, i think we had a moment before."""
9,9,rachel:," ""yeah.""    ""me too."""
9,9,rachel:," ""well, but i'm not sure i really want to do anything about it."""
9,9,rachel:," ""yeah.""  ""me neither."" "
9,9,rachel:," ""well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"""
9,9,rachel:," ""yeah.  that works for me."" "
9,9,phoebe:," yeah, i see what you mean.  by the way, nice ross imitation."
9,9,rachel:," oh, thanks."
9,9,phoebe:," but, your rachel wasn't whiny enough."
9,9,rachel:, wha. . . hey!
9,9,phoebe:, better!
9,9,rachel:," well, the point is, maybe i should just stop waiting around for moments with ross, you know?  i should just . . . move on with my life."
9,9,phoebe:, really?  you're moving on from ross?
9,9,rachel:, i don't know.  do i have to decide right now?
9,9,phoebe:," well, you kind of just did.  that guy is going to call you tonight.  ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message."
9,9,rachel:," oh god, ross.  ross is going to pick up the phone.  oh, i have to get my number back.    oh my god.  he's gone."
9,9,phoebe:, ross and rachel's apartment.  ross and mike are sitting on the sofa.  ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while mike blows his cheeks out.  ross blows a piece of fuzz from his finger.)
9,9,mike:," ya know, i'm going to take off."
9,9,ross:, so soon?
9,9,mike:," well, yeah."
9,9,ross:," okay.  well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer."
9,9,mike:," ah, you mean lager."
9,9,ross:, ah yeah.  good times. 
9,9,mike:, oh. 
9,9,mike:, hello?
9,9,phoebe:," hey, mike, it's me.  listen, is um, is ross near you?"
9,9,mike:," uh, no.  i just left."
9,9,phoebe:," well, you have to go back in."
9,9,mike:," wha . . .?  go back?  to the ""land where time stands still""?"
9,9,phoebe:," i'm so sorry honey, but, okay, rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want ross to answer the phone.  so, you have to intercept all his calls."
9,9,mike:, i can't do that!
9,9,phoebe:, he says he can't do that.
9,9,rachel:," oh give me , , ,    hi, mike?  hi.  listen.  i know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?  if you do this i . . . phoebe will . . . do anything you want.  seriously, i'm talking dirty stuff."
9,9,phoebe:," all right.   hello?  hi.  i'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff."
9,9,mike:," all right.  i'll do it.    but really, how much dirtier can it get?"
9,9,phoebe:," oh, mike.  bye. "
9,9,mike:, hey buddy.
9,9,ross:," uh, hi."
9,9,mike:," um, can i come back in?"
9,9,ross:,   why?  
9,9,mike:," i, i was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about."
9,9,ross:, but you left. 
9,9,joey:," wow!  that didn't take long.  i thought you said tulsa was, like a three hour flight."
9,9,chandler:," well, you're forgetting about the time difference. "
9,9,monica:, chandler!  you're home!
9,9,chandler:," that's right.  you're husband's home.  so, now the sex can stop. "
9,9,monica:, what are you saying?
9,9,chandler:, joey said that you're in here with another man.
9,9,monica:, there's no man in here.  how dare you accuse me of that.  
9,9,joey:," all right.  all right.  then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?    bwa ah ah! "
9,9,chandler:, what is he doing?
9,9,monica:, i arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
9,9,joey:," bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows."
9,9,chandler:," all right.  well, i'll check the guest room."
9,9,joey:,   why do i smell men's cologne?
9,9,monica:, i think that's you.
9,9,joey:,   oh yeah.  i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
9,9,chandler:, there's nobody here joe.
9,9,joey:, i guess not.
9,9,monica:, i can't believe you thought i was cheating.  you own me an apology.
9,9,joey:," yeah, right monica.  i'm so sorry."
9,9,monica:," ah, it's an honest mistake.  it could happen to anyone.  all right, see ya."
9,9,joey:," whoa, whoa.  wait a minute.  wait a minute.  if you just got back from tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?"
9,9,chandler:, i climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet? 
9,9,mike:," so, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing.  fascinating isn't it."
9,9,ross:," maybe you should look up ""fascinating."" "
9,9,mike:, i'll get it.    hello?  ross's place.  mike speaking.    it's for you.
9,9,ross:, i don't understand what just happened here. 
9,9,joey:, what's going on?
9,9,chandler:," i'm sorry.  i, i told you i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend the night with monica and i, i didn't know . . .  i didn't think you'd understand."
9,9,joey:," what? you think i'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?  huh?  do you think i'm like, ""duh.""  "
9,9,monica:, joey?
9,9,joey:, yeah?  
9,9,monica:, i don't know what to say.  we shouldn't have lied to you.
9,9,chandler:, yeah.  i feel so bad.  is there anything i can do to make it up to you?
9,9,joey:," yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though i know you said you couldn't.  but then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head."
9,9,chandler:, i'm sorry.  that's the one thing i can't do.  i promised i'd be with monica.
9,9,joey:, all right.
9,9,monica:, you can go.
9,9,chandler:, what?
9,9,monica:, you should go to the game.  it's okay.  i want you to.
9,9,chandler:, really?  you're gonna be okay?
9,9,monica:," yeah, i'll be fine.  you know, maybe i'll stay here and practice the art of seduction."
9,9,chandler:," you're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?"
9,9,monica:, it's gonna be so hot!  
9,9,chandler:," okay, bye."

9,10,aired:, stephan hoffmeister 
9,10,phoebe:," ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""merry christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"""
9,10,joey:," wow, that was great! you really wrote that?"
9,10,phoebe:, uh huh.
9,10,chandler:," say goodbye elves, i'm off to tulsa."

9,10,ross:, i can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
9,10,chandler:," i'm sorry, i won't be here."
9,10,monica:," it's just... it's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, i understand."

9,10,monica:, you're not gonna be here new year's eve??

9,10,wendy:, hey!
9,10,others:, hey.
9,10,chandler:, hey. where've you been?
9,10,wendy:," i was, uh, checking out that insurance company's christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and i just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. so i stole ther ham. "
9,10,chandler:," you hear that? you may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
9,10,claudia:, my kid's in a play right now.
9,10,chandler:," y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up! i had a little talk with the boys in new york, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order."
9,10,ken:," ""a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet""."
9,10,chandler:," well, that's like money in your pocket! alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!"
9,10,wendy:, *now* it feels like christmas.
9,10,chandler:," i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
9,10,ken:, you can come to my house!
9,10,chandler:," haha, no thanks!"
9,10,wendy:, that was a nice pep talk.
9,10,chandler:," oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
9,10,wendy:," so, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?"
9,10,chandler:," typical christmas y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional... "
9,10,phoebe:," so here is a, a very special holiday song that i wrote for some very important people to me. ""went to the store, sat on santa's lap. asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. said all you need is to write them a song. now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. no, don't sing along. monica, moncia, have a happy hanukkah. saw santa claus, he said hello to ross. and please tell joey, christmas will be snowy! and rachel and chandler, have err umm glander!!"" happy holidays, everybody! "
9,10,rachel:," okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet."
9,10,chandler:," i can save you time ladies, i'm right here."
9,10,phoebe:," yeah, chandler why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern you."
9,10,rachel:, we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
9,10,chandler:, what? that's terrible!
9,10,phoebe:," no no, we do it every year!"
9,10,chandler:," oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
9,10,phoebe:," no, yeah, we never find them! she's always best at us, that wily... minx."
9,10,rachel:," don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok?"
9,10,chandler:," no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents!"
9,10,phoebe:," oh no, we have to!"
9,10,chandler:," no, you don't have to, and you can't because i, i live here too."
9,10,phoebe:," well then, you should look with us."
9,10,chandler:, why?
9,10,rachel:," chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for christmas?"
9,10,chandler:," no, i have a great idea for a present for her."
9,10,phoebe:," oh, that's it? a great idea! oh yeah."
9,10,rachel:," chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you've just gotten her one great present? i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?"
9,10,chandler:," if i help, we can find 'em faster!"
9,10,rachel:, that's right! 
9,10,phoebe:," ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
9,10,rachel:," oh, it's a macy's bag! "

9,10,chandler:," ok, pheebs, your turn."
9,10,phoebe:," ahh, toilet seat covers! is that what you were doing while i was getting gas?"
9,10,joey:, uh huh.

9,10,chandler:," and, a lemon lime."
9,10,ross:," well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater."
9,10,chandler:, and last but not least. 
9,10,joey:, they're ribbed for *your* pleasure. 
9,10,ross:," ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?"
9,10,ben:, cool!
9,10,ross:, yeah!
9,10,monica:, come on ben.

9,10,ross:," i'm the holiday armadillo, your part jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?"
9,10,chandler:, what?
9,10,monica:," okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's a sentence i'd never thought i'd say. "
9,10,ross:, what are you doing?
9,10,chandler:," you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!"
9,10,ross:," thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
9,10,chandler:, why?
9,10,ross:," because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're you're wrecking it."
9,10,chandler:, but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
9,10,ross:," i'm sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
9,10,chandler:," fine, i'll give the suit back. "
9,10,monica:," hey, you think, you can keep it another night? "
9,10,chandler:, santa? really?
9,10,monica:," yeah, is that okay?"
9,10,chandler:, did your dad ever dress up like santa?
9,10,monica:, no.
9,10,chandler:, then it's okaaay! 
9,10,chandler:," you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your families. it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve. "
9,10,chandler:," did i not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? alright, look, go! go home, okay? merry christmas! go. "
9,10,chandler:," good, god's speed, good people! you're not gonna go?"

9,10,chandler:," the wife says ""hi!""."
9,10,wendy:, ah. fun conversation?
9,10,chandler:," ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen."
9,10,wendy:," huh? really? hm, that'd be so terrible? "
9,10,chandler:," this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie. "
9,10,chandler:," whoa ho, back off, missy! "
9,10,wendy:, ...missy?
9,10,chandler:, i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma?

9,10,wendy:, so? i'm married. 
9,10,chandler:, i'm *happily* married.
9,10,wendy:, oh. what's *that* like?
9,10,chandler:," right. so, i'm sorry..."
9,10,wendy:," seriously? happily married. so that phone call before, that was ... happy?"
9,10,chandler:," right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
9,10,wendy:," if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending christmas with me? "
9,10,chandler:," i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
9,10,monica:, really?
9,10,chandler:, you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... whoa! whoa! whoa! what's going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?
9,10,monica:," well, not anymore."
9,10,chandler:, but we don't do that.
9,10,monica:," i know, i just thought it would be fun."
9,10,chandler:, how drunk are you?
9,10,monica:, drunk enough that i know i wanna do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
9,10,chandler:, that's the perfect amount!
9,10,monica:, okay! 
9,10,monica:, y'know what's weird?
9,10,chandler:, what?
9,10,monica:, this doesn't feel weird!
9,10,chandler:, i know.
9,10,monica:, you're a really good kisser.
9,10,chandler:," well, i have kissed over four women. do you wanna get under the covers?"
9,10,monica:, hm hmm!
9,10,chandler:, okay! 
9,10,monica:, wow! you are really fast!
9,10,chandler:, it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
9,10,monica:, we're gonna see each other naked.
9,10,chandler:, yep!
9,10,monica:, do you wanna do it at the same time?
9,10,chandler:, count of three?
9,10,monica:, one!
9,10,chandler:, two!
9,10,monica:, two!
9,10,both:, three! 
9,10,chandler:, well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
9,10,monica:," eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
9,10,chandler:, eh! 
9,10,chandler:," so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
9,10,monica:," well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him."
9,10,chandler:," y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this."
9,10,monica:, i think you're better than you think you are.
9,10,chandler:," really? okay, so..."
9,10,monica:, know when to stop.
9,10,chandler:," y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay?"
9,10,monica:, yeah. don't do the dance.
9,10,chandler:, right! 
9,10,monica:," i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
9,10,chandler:," okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
9,10,monica:, you're so efficient. i love you!
9,10,chandler:, let's go! 
9,10,monica:," no no no, wait! we need something old!"
9,10,chandler:," oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve."
9,10,monica:, that'll work!
9,10,chandler:, i don't think so.
9,10,monica:," okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
9,10,chandler:, here just...take this. 
9,10,monica:, that's stealing!
9,10,chandler:," no, we'll we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress. "
9,10,monica:, ohh. 
9,10,chandler:," okay, one thing at a time. "
9,10,monica:," listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
9,10,chandler:, ehh.
9,10,monica:," eh, you work for that."
9,10,chandler:," look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
9,10,monica:, you do?!
9,10,chandler:," yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
9,10,monica:," oh, you're so sweet. oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
9,10,chandler:," eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
9,10,monica:, you thought about that?
9,10,chandler:, yeah.
9,10,monica:, how many kids were we gonna have?
9,10,chandler:," uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
9,10,monica:, what else did you think about?
9,10,chandler:," well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old."
9,10,monica:," y'know what? i i don't want a big, fancy wedding."
9,10,chandler:, sure you do.
9,10,monica:," no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage."
9,10,chandler:, you sure?
9,10,monica:, uh hmm.
9,10,chandler:, i love you so much.
9,10,monica:, i love you. 
9,10,rachel:," oohh, i love it!"
9,10,ross:, really? you're not gonna return it?
9,10,rachel:," well, not this second!"
9,10,phoebe:," hey look, you guys, it's snowing! "
9,10,rachel:," oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
9,10,ross:," wow, it really is! "
9,10,monica:," ""wendy"" is a fat girl name."
9,10,phoebe:, aren't we done with that?
9,10,monica:," okay, fine. let's talk about snow. do you think it's snowing in tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine? "
9,10,chandler:, hey!

9,10,chandler:, i never want to leave you again!
9,10,monica:," but i thought if you left, you get fired."
9,10,chandler:, turns out they can't fire me. because i quit.
9,10,monica:, what?
9,10,ross:," what, you, you really quit your job?"
9,10,chandler:," yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
9,10,rachel:, what do you really want to do?
9,10,chandler:, i have *not* thought this through!
9,10,monica:, oh my god!
9,10,chandler:," i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it."
9,10,monica:," no, i think that this is what you wanna do, i think it's great!"
9,10,chandler:, thanks!
9,10,phoebe:," chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined."

9,10,rachel:, wha... are you kidding? i can't return this.
9,10,chandler:," i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys."
9,10,joey:, mine's is to lilian myers.
9,10,chandler:, i don't have a *job*! *closing credits* 
9,10,chandler:," actuary... no. book keeper... no. topless dancer... hey, d'you know what i just realized? you are the sole wage earner. *you* are the head of the household. i don't do anything i'm a kept man!"
9,10,monica:," you are! hey, here's twenty bucks. why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while i'm at work tomorrow? "
9,11,chandler:, hey!
9,11,monica:," good morning, tiger! i'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. you're gonna get me good and pregnant."
9,11,chandler:, i've got nowhere to go this morning. i'm unemployed! i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life.
9,11,monica:," well, i just lost my erection."
9,11,chandler:," i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself? "
9,11,monica:, you're supposed to find your passion in life. you can be whatever you wanna be now. it's exciting.
9,11,chandler:, but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start. 
9,11,monica:," hey, wait a second. i can help you with this. you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. there could be folders and files! "
9,11,chandler:, hey! this is where your hyper organized pain in the ass stuff pays off!
9,11,monica:, i know!!! my erection is back! 
9,11,joey:, thank you!
9,11,phoebe:," joey, can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
9,11,joey:, okay. phoebe thank you. thank you! 
9,11,joey:," pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian?"
9,11,phoebe:," i'm sorry, it's just, i'm a little short on cash. "
9,11,joey:, if you want i could loan you some money?
9,11,phoebe:," oh no, no, no. i learned never to borrow money from friends. no, that's why richard dreyfuss and i don't speak anymore."
9,11,joey:," oh, hey, how about this? wanna be an extra on my show?"
9,11,phoebe:, you could do that?
9,11,joey:," yeah, yeah. the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need. "
9,11,phoebe:," oh my god, i'm gonna be on tv!"
9,11,joey:," okay, now. i gotta tell you, being on tv isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
9,11,phoebe:," oh, really?"
9,11,joey:, no it is awesome! 
9,11,ross:, hi guys.
9,11,all:, 
9,11,phoebe:," wow! hey, why are you all dressed up?"
9,11,ross:, rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone. doesn't she look cute?
9,11,joey:, she sure does. why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
9,11,rachel:," well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" i'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!"
9,11,ross:," i think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? she's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a line skirts. can i get a blue bow? "
9,11,monica:," okay, i have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision."
9,11,chandler:, how long was i in there?
9,11,monica:, okay. let us start with the a's. advertising.
9,11,chandler:, wait. advertising! that's a great idea!
9,11,monica:, don't you want to look through the rest?
9,11,chandler:," i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
9,11,monica:," you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? ooh, now i get to use my shredder!"
9,11,chandler:," i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? ""cheese. it's milk that you chew."" ""crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"""
9,11,monica:," i got one. ""socks. because your family's feet deserve the best."""
9,11,chandler:, honey? leave it to the pros.
9,11,monica:, i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. maybe i can get him to meet you? give me the phone.
9,11,chandler:," ""the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
9,11,monica:," ""marriage. it's not for everybody."" "
9,11,rachel:, that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl. 
9,11,ross:," yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread. "
9,11,rachel:, i'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . who the hell are you!?
9,11,guy:, who the hell are you?
9,11,rachel:, i'm the hell person whose office this is!
9,11,ross:," good one, rach."
9,11,guy:," i'm gavin mitchell, the person who's taken over your job."
9,11,rachel:, excuse me?
9,11,gavin:," oh, your baby's so cute. why did you put a pink bow on a boy? "
9,11,phoebe:," joey, look at me! i'm a nurse!"
9,11,joey:," yes you are. i think it may be time for my sponge bath. sorry, i'm just so used to hitting on the extras. so, are you excited about your scene?"
9,11,phoebe:, yeah! but i'm a little shaky and nervous. 
9,11,joey:," oh, relax. don't be. you'll be fine, you'll be fine. they'll probably just make you stand in the back."
9,11,director:," okay, okay, okay! you. here, come here, here. you're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. you're gonna move on ""action!"" you're gonna walk over to the operating table. you're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. don't walk too fast! but don't doddle."
9,11,phoebe:," okay, now. what?"
9,11,director:, and...action!! 
9,11,director:, cut! cut!
9,11,phoebe:," i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i'm just a little nervous."
9,11,director:," well, don't be."
9,11,phoebe:," okay, that helps."
9,11,director:, and...action! 
9,11,director:, cut!
9,11,joey:," hey, you know what? don't worry, pheebs! it usually takes me three takes too! alright, eight."
9,11,director:, and...action! 
9,11,interviewer:," so, do you have any other question about advertising?"
9,11,chandler:," no, no. but let me show you what i can do. ""bagels and donuts. round food for every mood."""
9,11,interviewer:, monica warned me you might do that. i actually think we might have something for you at the agency. 
9,11,chandler:, really? that's great!
9,11,interviewer:, it's an unpaid internship.
9,11,chandler:," it's funny. when you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
9,11,interviewer:, come on now. monica has a good job. and it's not like you have a family to support.
9,11,chandler:," actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she's probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now."
9,11,interviewer:, stop!
9,11,interviewer:, okay. 
9,11,rachel:," wait a minute! what do you mean, you're taking over my job?"
9,11,gavin:," well, while you were on your baby vacation i was doing your job."
9,11,rachel:, a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
9,11,gavin:, clearly you've never been to sandles paradise island.
9,11,rachel:," alright! don't get too comfortable there, because i'm back in two weeks! and i want everything back to the way it was. i can't say that i care too much for the way you've rearranged my office. "
9,11,gavin:, i can't say i care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
9,11,rachel:, excuse me?
9,11,ross:, rach we have a code brown situation.
9,11,rachel:," can you please, please take care of it for me?"
9,11,ross:," alright, but you have to do one sometime."
9,11,rachel:, let me just get this straight! so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
9,11,gavin:," well, there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren all together."
9,11,rachel:, that's right. you're very cheeky for a temp. 
9,11,gavin:, i'm not a temp. i was transferred here from another department.
9,11,rachel:," oh yeah, what department was that? the jerk department?"
9,11,gavin:," oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit."
9,11,rachel:," gavin, ralph loved your ideas."
9,11,rachel:," rachel, i see you've met gavin. i must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. but then, gavin to the rescue. super gavin!"
9,11,rachel:," that's great. so now, super gavin, when i come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
9,11,gavin:," well, that's up to mr. zelner. i'm sure he will make the right decision."
9,11,rachel:," incidentally, when are you coming back?"
9,11,rachel:, today.
9,11,gavin:, you said two weeks.
9,11,rachel:," no, i said today! see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening. "
9,11,joey:, hey.
9,11,phoebe:," hey. so, what did he say?"
9,11,joey:," ""if your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, i'm gonna fire her mother puppy ass."""
9,11,phoebe:," i'm sorry, i can't do this. i'm not an actor."
9,11,joey:," that's right, you're not. you're a nurse. you're nurse with tray. "
9,11,phoebe:, joey.
9,11,joey:," no, no. nurse with tray doesn't know joey, she doesn't have time for friends. she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!"
9,11,phoebe:, who dies?
9,11,joey:, man with eye patch! you get in there and you do your job.
9,11,phoebe:," yes, doctor."
9,11,joey:, okay.
9,11,director:," okay, let's try this one more time. "
9,11,phoebe:," hang in there, man with eye patch, your tray is coming!"
9,11,director:, and...action!
9,11,phoebe:," yes, i did it!!! i nailed it!!! yay! what's next?"
9,11,director:, the rest of the scene.
9,11,phoebe:," okay, from the top, people! "
9,11,rachel:," listen. sudden change of plans. my maternity leave just ended. they told me that if i didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me."
9,11,ross:," what? no, that's illegal. i'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even..."
9,11,rachel:," alright, alright. calm down norma rae. they didn't actually say that. i'm just afraid if i don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. "
9,11,ross:, what about emma? we don't have a nanny.
9,11,rachel:," i know. you know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. can you please just take care of her for today?"
9,11,ross:, absolutely. just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
9,11,rachel:," come on, i don't know what else to do."
9,11,ross:," fine, fine. we'll have fun, won't we? yes, we will, yes we will. "
9,11,rachel:, ross?
9,11,ross:, huh?
9,11,rachel:, you're pretty. 
9,11,chandler:," whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family."
9,11,ross:, so you have to tell monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
9,11,chandler:, yeah. 
9,11,ross:, good bye.
9,11,monica:," okay, it's baby time. pants off bing. didn't see you there geller. "
9,11,chandler:," yeah, ross is here so..."
9,11,ross:," yeah, and i was really hoping that i could hang out. what do you feel like doing?"
9,11,monica:, we're gonna have sex.
9,11,ross:, i don't feel like having sex. maybe we can watch a movie or something.
9,11,monica:, let me put it this way. we're having sex whether you're here or not.
9,11,ross:, pants off bing! 
9,11,rachel:," alright. now that i'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?"
9,11,gavin:," well, i've changed your screensaver from that picture of *nsync."
9,11,rachel:," hey, they were popular when i left!"
9,11,gavin:," also, i've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow."
9,11,rachel:," well, i should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?"
9,11,gavin:, that's gonna take weeks. why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
9,11,rachel:," oh, no no no no. i see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. okay, i've had it for five years, and i know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!"
9,11,gavin:, fine. 
9,11,rachel:, oh god. you've totally messed with the back support of my chair. how do you fix this?
9,11,gavin:," hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out."
9,11,rachel:," fine, i will. alright, fill me in! "
9,11,ross:, hey.
9,11,chandler:, hey.
9,11,ross:, you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine.
9,11,chandler:," oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
9,11,monica:," hi, good morning lover. i gotta say after last night, i'm a little weak in the knees."
9,11,ross:, here's an idea. you walk into a room...take a quick scan!
9,11,monica:, sorry. but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
9,11,chandler:," oh god, i have to tell you something. you're not pregnant. "
9,11,monica:, what are you talking about?
9,11,chandler:, that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it.
9,11,monica:, what!? you faked it?
9,11,ross:," you know what? i don't need a tie. i mean, it's better, open collar. you know, it's more casual "
9,11,phoebe:," joey, listen. i can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. yesterday i was a nurse, and today i'm a waitress at a cafe?"
9,11,joey:," oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. it's okay. "
9,11,phoebe:," well, it's not okay, because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. and now suddenly i'm the waitress? that's gonna confuse my fans. "
9,11,joey:," maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
9,11,phoebe:," uhuh. because i'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
9,11,joey:, nice.
9,11,phoebe:, wait a minute. dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital. wouldn't i come over to say hi to him?
9,11,joey:," no, no. see, you and drake are having a fight. "
9,11,phoebe:, about what?
9,11,joey:, he slept with you and then never called you.
9,11,phoebe:, and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky.
9,11,director:," okay, okay, from the top. and...action!"
9,11,man:," i'm surprised to, but yet here i am. "
9,11,director:," cut, cut! what are you doing!?"
9,11,phoebe:," yeah, well, i'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back."
9,11,extra:, me too!
9,11,joey:," oh, calm down! she means on the show! we need some new extras around here! "
9,11,gavin:," wow, you're here already."
9,11,rachel:," yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation. i actually made a few changes, but i think i'm caught up on everything. so ask me anything!"
9,11,gavin:, how do you fix the chair?
9,11,rachel:," good, because it's in ten minutes."
9,11,rachel:," well, then gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. ralph needs to leave early today. he's going helicopter shopping."
9,11,rachel:," well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him!"
9,11,gavin:, you can do the presentation.
9,11,rachel:," no, i can't, i have a baby."
9,11,gavin:, i'll watch her.
9,11,rachel:, why would you do that?
9,11,gavin:," because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy."
9,11,rachel:, that's really nice.
9,11,gavin:, i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
9,11,rachel:," then you're not gonna like what's coming. i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. thank you, thank you."
9,11,gavin:," i'm really fine, don't worry, i'm great with children. gavin mitchell. pleased to meet you. "
9,11,joey:, please don't fire my friend. just let me talk to her.
9,11,director:," okay, okay. but this is her last chance. "
9,11,joey:," thank you, thank you. how about i do something for you? tomorrow, i'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
9,11,joey:," hey, listen pheebs. i was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit drake, you just wait on the tables?"
9,11,phoebe:, i can't do that. i'm an actor. i have a process.
9,11,joey:, you're a masseuse. you have a table with a hole in it.
9,11,phoebe:," wait a minute, i see what's happening here. you're threatened. "
9,11,joey:, what?
9,11,phoebe:," yeah, i'm so good in this scene that i'm stealing focus from you. well, rise to the challenge tribianni 'cause i just raised the bar. come join me up here!"
9,11,joey:," yeah, you can fire her, but i would call security, she won't go easy. "
9,11,monica:, you faked it? you couldn't have faked it!
9,11,chandler:, oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises. 
9,11,monica:," guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that's ours! besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
9,11,chandler:," that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
9,11,monica:, like a month?
9,11,chandler:, or a year?
9,11,monica:," really, you want to wait a year?"
9,11,chandler:," it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. ""pants. like shorts, but longer."" it'll probably be more than a year. "
9,11,monica:, i really wanna have a baby.
9,11,chandler:," yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back. "
9,11,monica:," no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration."
9,11,chandler:, i quit and you learn what i do?
9,11,monica:," it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. i mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. there's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons. "
9,11,chandler:, i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 
9,11,monica:," it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, i won't have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? messes up all the ribbons?! what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? where will all the ribbons go!?!"
9,11,chandler:, should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
9,11,monica:," yes, please!"
9,11,chandler:," oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time."
9,11,monica:," i know you botched that operation on purpose. i can't prove it yet, but when i do, you'll be going to jail for murder. i don't care if you are my brother."
9,11,man:, i'm not your brother.
9,12,aired:, roni raab 
9,12,chandler:, hey
9,12,joey:, hey. so where's mon?
9,12,chandler:," oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for rachel's birthday party tonight."
9,12,joey:, and you're not helping?
9,12,chandler:," i tried, but apparantly singing ""i will survive"" in a helium voice not helping. "
9,12,ross:, hey! happy birthday ...
9,12,rachel:," shhh don't say that loud, gunther's gonna want to hug me."
9,12,ross:, hi.
9,12,molly:, hi. 
9,12,ross:," ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
9,12,joey:," you damn right i am, i've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
9,12,rachel:," ok, you know what, i'm just gonna take her outside."
9,12,molly:," no, you stay, i'll do it . "
9,12,rachel:," ok, thank you."
9,12,molly:, nice to meet you guys .
9,12,joey:," yeah, you too. "
9,12,rachel:," oh, wow, molly is just great!"
9,12,ross:, yeah.
9,12,chandler:," yes, bravo on the hot nanny."
9,12,rachel:, what? you really think she's hot?
9,12,chandler:, are you kidding? if i wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
9,12,rachel:, and joey?
9,12,joey:, how do you think she's doing?
9,12,rachel:, am i the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? ross?
9,12,ross:," eh, i mean, i mena she's not unattractive but hot? i ...."
9,12,rachel:, thank you! 
9,12,chandler:, now that rachel's gone?
9,12,rachel:, so hot i cried myself to sleep last night. opening credits 
9,12,phoebe:," hey mike, what's the capital of peru?"
9,12,mike:, lima.
9,12,phoebe:," no. it starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle."
9,12,mike:," you know, kinda think of it, the capital of peru is ""vtox"". oh god! oh!"
9,12,phoebe:, what?
9,12,mike:," ok, i don't want to freak you out or anything, but i think i just saw a rat in your cupboard."
9,12,phoebe:," oh, whew, no, that's bob."
9,12,mike:," what, is he your pet rat?"
9,12,phoebe:," well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who i put food out for, you know. kinda like santa. except santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies."
9,12,mike:," you can't keep a rat in your appartment! they're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus."
9,12,phoebe:, what are those?
9,12,mike:, i don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. you have to get rid of it!
9,12,phoebe:," ok, fine, if it means that much to you i'll get rid of bob."
9,12,mike:, thank you.
9,12,phoebe:," so weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. "
9,12,rachel:, hello.
9,12,gavin:, hello
9,12,rachel:," gavin, i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an appology."
9,12,gavin:, for what?
9,12,rachel:," well, when we first met, you know, i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ..."
9,12,gavin:, is this your first appology?
9,12,rachel:," no, i just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. and i i think you're a really good guy and i'm sorry that i misjudged you. "
9,12,heather:, good morning! 
9,12,rachel:," hello. but you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, i am just really really happy ... i'm sorry, obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so i'll just wait 'till it's finished."
9,12,gavin:, what?
9,12,rachel:, i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
9,12,gavin:," i wasn't checking her out. i'm in fashion, i was looking at her skirt. or was it pants? i didn't really see what happened below the ass area."
9,12,rachel:," oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
9,12,gavin:, why do you even care if i was looking at her? are you jealous?
9,12,rachel:," oh yeah, i'm jealous. ""oh gavin, please, please look at my ass"". stop looking at my ass! i mean, i just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? this is a work environment, she's your subordinate."
9,12,gavin:, i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag.
9,12,rachel:," that is totally different for two reasons. one i didn't know that you knew that. and two, i wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship."
9,12,gavin:, huh. what's tag's last name?
9,12,rachel:," it was ... oh my god. he didn't have a last name. it was just ""tag"". you know, like cher, or, you know, moses."
9,12,gavin:, but it was a deap meaningful relationship.
9,12,rachel:," oh, you know what my first impression of you was absolutely right. you are arrogant, you are pompous ... morgan! morgan! tag's last name was morgan! huh!"
9,12,gavin:, it was jones.
9,12,rachel:," yeah well what are you, his boyfriend? "
9,12,joey:," man, i wish i had a nanny like you."
9,12,molly:," you mean, when you were a baby."
9,12,joey:, sure. 
9,12,monica:, would you stop staring at her?
9,12,chandler:, i wasn't staring. i was leering.
9,12,monica:, what's the big deal with her? maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
9,12,ross:," yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. you know, when it's right there in your face. me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive. makes me feel like i earned it."
9,12,chandler:, looks like joey is doing allright with her.
9,12,monica:," yeah. hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once."
9,12,molly:, i'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
9,12,ross:," ok, i'll be home right after work. ok, by emma wemma demma, i love you wovyou dovyou ..."
9,12,molly:, bye
9,12,monica:, they've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk it's not so good.
9,12,molly:," bye, emma wemma demma."
9,12,rachel:," hey, listen, joey, about molly, i really prefer if you didn't go after her."
9,12,joey:, why not?
9,12,rachel:," because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away."
9,12,joey:," so, what, you think i'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? yeah, sounds about right."
9,12,ross:," come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? just just forget about her, ok? just, she's off limits."
9,12,joey:," oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? now that you told me i can't have it makes me want her even more!"
9,12,ross:," what are you, a child?"
9,12,joey:, yes!
9,12,ross:," joey, come on now, for me! please, just just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else."
9,12,joey:, fine. 
9,12,monica:, take me home! 
9,12,phoebe:, hey mikey
9,12,mike:, hey p
9,12,phoebe:, what are you doing?
9,12,mike:, setting rat traps.
9,12,phoebe:, to kill bob??
9,12,mike:," no, no, to test his neck strength."
9,12,phoebe:," no, mike, i don't want to kill him! i thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
9,12,mike:," ok, ok, i'll throw away the traps."
9,12,phoebe:," i'll find bob, i'll get him. bob? bob! robert! oh wait, i think i hear him. oh oh my god! bob had babies! bob's a mom!"
9,12,mike:, better think of a new name for him.
9,12,phoebe:," i don't know, i kinda like bob for a girl."
9,12,mike:," i don't know, i mean i'm not sure ..."
9,12,phoebe:," oh my god, we killed bob!"
9,12,mike:," maybe it wasn't bob, maybe it was a mouse."
9,12,phoebe:, suzie? 
9,12,ross:, whazzup??
9,12,chandler:," seriously dude, 3 years ago."
9,12,ross:," listen, can you do me a favor? i'm gonna be out today. can you just keep an eye on joey, make sure nothing happens between him and molly?"
9,12,chandler:, you don't trust him?
9,12,ross:," wh no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny""."
9,12,chandler:," is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? because i could get a job any day now."
9,12,ross:," you do appear right on the cusp of something. come on man, i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?"
9,12,chandler:," allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it."
9,12,ross:," well we gotta do something, ok? nannies like her don't grow on trees. "
9,12,chandler:, picturing that tree?
9,12,ross:," i am, yes. "
9,12,chandler:," where you going, joe? "
9,12,joey:, for a walk.
9,12,chandler:, oh. you mind if i join you?
9,12,joey:," actually, that will be long. you know, i really need to organize my thoughts."
9,12,chandler:, your thoughts? plural?
9,12,joey:," allright, fine, i only have one thought! it's about the hot nanny, i gotta see her!"
9,12,chandler:," i'm afraid i can't let you do that, joe."
9,12,joey:," now you're telling me i can't see her?? you guys are killing me! she's forbidden fruit! it's like ... like she's the princess and i'm the stable boy ... why are you doing this, huh? did ross tell you not to let me go over there?"
9,12,chandler:," yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can't let you go."
9,12,joey:, huh. interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against the world. this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
9,12,chandler:, great novels? 
9,12,joey:, fine ... mediocre porn 
9,12,gavin:, gavin mitchelle's office.
9,12,rachel:," rachel green's office!! give me that phone! hello, this is rachel green, how can i help you? uh huh ... ok then ... i'll pass you back to your son "
9,12,gavin:," hey mom! no, that's just my secretary. "
9,12,rachel:," um, excuse me gavin, i have a question i need to ask you."
9,12,gavin:," mom, i'll call you later. yeah. yes?"
9,12,rachel:, if you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
9,12,gavin:," thank god you finally said that, i saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago. man, i really bug you, don't i?"
9,12,rachel:," oh, please, i don't care about you enough to bug me. in fact, from now on, i'm going take the high road. and i'm going be very very nice to you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now. "
9,12,monica:, hey rach!
9,12,rachel:, hi!
9,12,monica:, ready for your birthday lunch?
9,12,rachel:," yeah i am, i am! oh, but first of all, monica, i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend gavin mitchelle. "
9,12,gavin:, pleased to meet you.
9,12,monica:, pleased to meet you. so you're coming to rachel's party tonight?
9,12,rachel:," oh no no no no no, gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother. "
9,12,gavin:," well i don't mind, i'll cancel. i would never miss my secretary's birthday. "
9,12,rachel:, why did you invite him?? i can't stand that guy!
9,12,monica:, you were just being so nice to him!
9,12,rachel:, i was faking it! can't you tell when i'm being fake? 
9,12,rachel:," hey, mr philips, nice suit!"
9,12,monica:, right there! that was so fake!
9,12,rachel:, shh! 
9,12,rachel:," i still can't believe you invited gavin. allright, he is the last person i want to see."
9,12,monica:," oh, you're welcome for the party. i'm glad you're having a good time."
9,12,rachel:," god, i hope he doesn't show up. of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me."
9,12,monica:, does he?
9,12,rachel:, what?
9,12,monica:, maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. it's like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
9,12,rachel:," oh, monica, you think skippy liked you? honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over."
9,12,molly:," she's out, i'm gonna take her home."
9,12,rachel:," oh, ok, thank you. do you see what all the guys see in her?"
9,12,monica:, wouldn't kick her out of bed. no more vodka for me! 
9,12,joey:," hey rach, so can i sing happy birthday to you now?"
9,12,rachel:," yeah, sure!"
9,12,joey:," oh ... happy birth ... oh, see you later "
9,12,monica:," hey rach, somebody got you shoes!"
9,12,rachel:," oh, give me! "
9,12,phoebe:," be careful, be careful! these are my rat babies!"
9,12,mike:, yeah. we have rat babies now.
9,12,rachel:," ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?"
9,12,monica:, so this is what a stroke feels like.
9,12,phoebe:," i had to bring them! we killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. you know, they require constant care. you should know that, rachel, you're a mother."
9,12,rachel:, are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
9,12,phoebe:," no! seven rats! i think we should take them home, we need feed them."
9,12,rachel:," whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?"
9,12,phoebe:," well i'm sorry rachel, but i'm not like you, ok? not everyone can afford help. "
9,12,ross:, where the hell are joey and molly? i asked you to watch them.
9,12,chandler:," i'm sorry, i got a little occupied."
9,12,ross:, we have to stop them before something happens!
9,12,chandler:," right behind you, big guy! "
9,12,joey:," so you see, molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. it takes a lot of hard work."
9,12,molly:, so where did you study?
9,12,joey:," oh, i didn't go to college."
9,12,molly:," no, where did you study acting?"
9,12,joey:, molly ... people don't study acting ... 
9,12,ross:," molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?"
9,12,molly:," sure, i'll go check on emma."
9,12,ross:, thanx. 
9,12,joey:, will the stable boy never get the princess??
9,12,ross:," what do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?"
9,12,joey:, come on! joe!
9,12,joey:, ok 
9,12,woman:," hi, is molly here?"
9,12,ross:," yeah, come on in. molly?"
9,12,molly:," hey! guys, this is tabatha . i'll see you tomorrow."
9,12,ross:," ok ... well, uh, joey, i guess we have no problem."
9,12,joey:," it's like my favorite fairy tale come true! the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian! "
9,12,phoebe:," ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed."
9,12,mike:," hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?"
9,12,phoebe:," well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
9,12,mike:," ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?"
9,12,phoebe:, mate? they're all brothers and sisters.
9,12,mike:," yeah not such a problem with rats. no, they're more of a ""love the one you're with"" kind of animals."
9,12,phoebe:," no. wh get off your sister! oh my god, what are we gonna do? we have 7 rats. so what if each of them has 7 rats? and then each of those have 7 rats? that's like ... that's math i can't even do! what are we gonna do?"
9,12,mike:," well, i know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives."
9,12,phoebe:," yeah, ok. i guess you're right. allright, so we should just give them away. but to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. they're bob's favorites. "
9,12,mike:, it's gonna be ok.
9,12,phoebe:, you must think i'm crazy.
9,12,mike:," no, i think you're sweet."
9,12,phoebe:," good. it's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. i guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when i gave birth to my brother's triplets and i had to give them up. i haven't told you about that yet, have i? "
9,12,monica:, hey!
9,12,rachel:," hi. thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up?"
9,12,monica:," no way! you had your party, now i have mine! is everything alright?"
9,12,rachel:," yeah, i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over."
9,12,monica:," well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. that jerk gavin from your office didn't show up ."
9,12,rachel:, mmm hmm.
9,12,gavin:," yeah, hey. "
9,12,monica:," oh, we weren't talking about you. no, no way to recover."
9,12,rachel:, no. 
9,12,gavin:, nice party.
9,12,rachel:," well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9 ?? god! oh, this party was lame ..."
9,12,monica:," again, you're welcome."
9,12,gavin:," look, i'll just give you this and go."
9,12,rachel:," oh, you bought me a present! why?"
9,12,gavin:," well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. there are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. ok, i ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier."
9,12,rachel:," aww. well, ok, well that's very nice. and you wrote a card . ""from gavin"""
9,12,gavin:, i really mean it.
9,12,rachel:," awww, awww, it's beautiful."
9,12,gavin:," you don't mind? well, what do you know, it fits!"
9,12,rachel:," see, gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such a hard time?"
9,12,gavin:, i'm not sure.
9,12,rachel:, well monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
9,12,gavin:, i do have feelings for you.
9,12,rachel:, you do?
9,12,gavin:," yes, i feel that you are a little annoying."
9,12,rachel:," see? why, gavin, why? right when i'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ... ending credits"
9,12,chandler:," first i was afraid, i was petrified "
9,12,phoebe:, hey
9,12,chandler:, hi
9,12,phoebe:," listen, i think i've left something here."
9,12,chandler:," oh, well someone left this . this is yours?"
9,12,phoebe:," no, but i like it. i think i left one of my rat babies."
9,12,chandler:," oh, uh, well, i haven't seem it but if i do i'll let you know."
9,12,monica:, ohmygod! rat baby! rat baby! rat baby! 
9,12,phoebe:," ooh, maybe that's him!"
9,13,aired:, phdb and sebastiano 
9,13,chandler:, hey!
9,13,ross:, yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
9,13,chandler:, sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...i mean come on!!
9,13,ross:, ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about?
9,13,chandler:, no!
9,13,ross:, ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
9,13,chandler:," our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. and she said""no, no. it's too cold, nobody will go out there."" and i said ""maybe if we put some light out there they will"""
9,13,ross:," right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were no lights !"
9,13,chandler:, so are you gonna...talk to her?
9,13,ross:," why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!"
9,13,chandler:," you know when ""that's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
9,13,ross:," no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care but...at least she could have told me. you knowi...i've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will i ! very funny! ross is gay! ah! ah!"
9,13,chandler:, no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where you're moving?
9,13,ross:," i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.and then the other day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand."
9,13,chandler:," dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
9,13,ross:," well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter departmentalpotluck dinner."
9,13,chandler:, why did i get married?!     
9,13,joey:, hey! let me ask you guys something. i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks ishould have my eyebrows waxed. is that weird for a guy?
9,13,phoebe:, well it depends.
9,13,joey:, on...?
9,13,phoebe:, on how far along he's in the sex change process!
9,13,monica:," no i totally disagree. no i think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. such you an actor. not that you need to,your eyebrows are..."
9,13,joey:, ok! stop it you guys! stop staring! you're freaking me out!
9,13,phoebe:, your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
9,13,joey:, oh man! i have to get those done too?!
9,13,phoebe:, wow! talking about high maintenance
9,13,joey:, hey hey! you dye your hair!
9,13,phoebe:, i'm a woman!
9,13,joey:, arghhh! double standards!
9,13,phoebe:," oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar tonight?"
9,13,monica:, only if i don't have to get up and sing.
9,13,phoebe:," but everybody sings. it's so much fun! last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. so funny."
9,13,monica:," it's just, i'm not good at singing."
9,13,phoebe:, oh! what's the matter? are you scared? you're afraid i'm a better singer? you're afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing?
9,13,monica:," no no, it's not working on me. wow! i must be growing up!"
9,13,phoebe:, ok fine! please come and support mike. you don't have to sing.
9,13,monica:, so i don't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
9,13,phoebe:, while drinking...
9,13,monica:, i'm there!
9,13,rachel:, hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something really stupid.
9,13,phoebe:, well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
9,13,rachel:, no not that. i kissed gavin last night.
9,13,phoebe:, oh my god.
9,13,monica:, you kissed him?
9,13,rachel:," yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony and..."
9,13,monica:, wait wait wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i missed that?
9,13,phoebe:," it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper."
9,13,monica:, oh yeah...so how did you end up kissing?
9,13,rachel:," you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf..."
9,13,monica:, i thought you hated him?
9,13,rachel:," you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!"
9,13,monica:, so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
9,13,rachel:," i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy, you know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i don'tknow what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes."
9,13,monica:," sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to gavin, and you definitely should talk to ross"
9,13,rachel:, or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
9,13,phoebe:, hi
9,13,joey:, name?
9,13,joey:, ok. very good. have a seat right over here mr. bing and sonia will be right with you.

9,13,sonia:, oh absolutely.
9,13,joey:, oh good...
9,13,sonia:, are you looking to meet somebody?
9,13,joey:, all right let's just do this.
9,13,sonia:," we'll get to the wax in a minute. first i want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? this may sting just a little bit..."
9,13,joey:, please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god! my face! my face!! i'm all right! i'm all right!just a little bit of shock that's all but i'll be fine you can go again. i'm ok dammit! woman!! how hoooow! 
9,13,chandler:, hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on going?
9,13,ross:, not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
9,13,chandler:," well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. the personal ad writes itself...."
9,13,ross:, that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again?
9,13,chandler:, what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!
9,13,ross:, i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
9,13,chandler:," maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one time birthday thing"
9,13,ross:," no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar."
9,13,chandler:, did she go out with him?
9,13,ross:," no. when he called, i...i threw the message away."
9,13,chandler:, ah! the high road...
9,13,ross:, you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey check out those two blondes over there!hey come with me!
9,13,chandler:, are you trying to get everybody divorced?
9,13,ross:," you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? you...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that i'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one..."
9,13,chandler:, i thought i had to make the jokes!
9,13,ross:, don't you have to be at work?
9,13,chandler:," oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. we only need six more people for a human pyramid...swoop!! swoop!!"
9,13,ross:, sorry...we were just leaving
9,13,chandler:, we still got it!    
9,13,rachel:, who is it?
9,13,gavin:, gavin! i brought you some soup.
9,13,rachel:, why?
9,13,gavin:, i heard you were sick...
9,13,rachel:," oh! right! yeah! hold on, i'll be just clean up in here a little bit! hello gavin"
9,13,gavin:, i missed you at work today. how are you feeling?
9,13,rachel:," i a not gonna lie to you, i'm pretty sick"
9,13,gavin:, oh! good! because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i thought you called in sick to avoid me.
9,13,rachel:, oh no no no
9,13,gavin:, so i had fun last night
9,13,rachel:, so did i
9,13,gavin:, exactly how contagious is this thing you have? i mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
9,13,rachel:, it's just a cold
9,13,gavin:, do you have fever? let me see. hum...
9,13,rachel:, what? what's the matter?
9,13,gavin:, what's ross doing to you on that picture?
9,13,rachel:, oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. he thought it would be funny.
9,13,gavin:, right. right. ross. so what's the deal with you guys? i don't want to get in the middle of anything
9,13,rachel:," oh you're not. you're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about ross really, really. oh! hide! that's ross! hide! hide!"
9,13,gavin:, yeah! but you said not to worry about...
9,13,rachel:, i lied! and i'm not sick! just stay behind the curtain!
9,13,molly:, hi!
9,13,rachel:, oh! molly! you're not ross.
9,13,molly:," no i'm here to take emma to your mother's, remember?"
9,13,rachel:," right, right, yes!"
9,13,molly:, don't panic!
9,13,rachel:, what?
9,13,molly:, there is a man behind your curtain. i have a mace in my purse.
9,13,rachel:, no! that's ok! that's ok! that's ok! no no no no! this is my business associate gavin. he's just being silly.gavin come out from behind that curtain!
9,13,gavin:, hi! gavin! please to meet you. it was my idea to stand there.
9,13,molly:, hello! i just go and get emma.
9,13,rachel:, ok.
9,13,gavin:, so hum...why did i have to hide?
9,13,rachel:, i thought it was ross.
9,13,gavin:, so what if it was? i thought there was nothing going on between you two...
9,13,rachel:, there isn't. there is totally isn't.
9,13,gavin:, you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. i used to be arodeo clown.
9,13,rachel:," all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were here, which i shouldn't. you know ross and i are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...i don't know, i'm sorry, i'm just all over the place."
9,13,gavin:, it's ok. i know it's probably not my place but can i give you a piece of advice?
9,13,rachel:, yes
9,13,gavin:, i think you should talk to ross about all this.
9,13,rachel:, people keep saying that. oh i'm sorry gavin
9,13,gavin:, don't be. it's just bad timing.
9,13,rachel:, so seriously...rodeo clown?
9,13,gavin:," one of the best, ma'am, one of the best...    "
9,13,phoebe:," ""no time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!"" thank you! "
9,13,mike:," oh she's my girlfriend. that's not just how we do it here. i got to get a break and when we come back we've got kennethsinging ""i touch myself""...i'm not here to judge!"
9,13,phoebe:, hi hi...oh you have got to sing.
9,13,monica:, no i told you i can't.
9,13,phoebe:, but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
9,13,monica:, what have you heard me sing?
9,13,phoebe:, all the time when you're cooking.
9,13,monica:, what?
9,13,phoebe:," yeah you're always singing ""yummy yummy yummy, i've got love in my tummy"""
9,13,monica:, yeah i do rock that one.
9,13,phoebe:, ok so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
9,13,monica:, just a little but...it's just so scary! i don't even know what i would sing...
9,13,mike:, well i've got a book around...
9,13,monica:," ""delta dawn""    "
9,13,ross:," hi! i could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace"
9,13,woman:, you already hit on me an hour ago
9,13,ross:," right, so that's a firm ""no"". i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out."
9,13,chandler:," i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed"
9,13,ross:, this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i'm gonna die alone.
9,13,chandler:, by drowning or...?!
9,13,michelle:, i don't know sweetie.
9,13,michelle:," all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. i mean, am i so unlovable?"
9,13,chandler:, well...
9,13,ross:, i know!      
9,13,mike:," all right, that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of ""i touch myself"". coming up next we've got monicasinging ""delta dawn""."
9,13,monica:, wait wait! i can't sing in front of all these people.
9,13,phoebe:," just pretend they're not even here! it's ok monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway."
9,13,monica:," hi! i'm monica and i'm gonna be singing ""delta dawn""""delta dawn, what's that flower you have on? could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."""
9,13,phoebe:, can you totally see through her shirt ?
9,13,mike:, like an x ray. bad day not to wear a bra.
9,13,monica:," ""to take you to his mansion in the sky y?""    "
9,13,joey:," hey, i need your help."
9,13,chandler:," wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?"
9,13,joey:," look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my eyebrows shaped"
9,13,chandler:," i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
9,13,joey:," you may be a sissy but i'll still . all right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they dont match!"
9,13,chandler:, its like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
9,13,joey:," all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one soi dont look stupid for my pictures."
9,13,chandler:," ok. first of all, this is green!"
9,13,joey:, what the hell am i supposed to do!
9,13,chandler:," all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you."
9,13,joey:," what, what."
9,13,chandler:," ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his business partners."
9,13,joey:, oh my god!
9,13,chandler:," yeah, well, i guess you dont need my help victor victoria!"
9,13,joey:," ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help, but chandler i dont know if i can take anymoreplucking. it hurts so bad!"
9,13,chandler:," oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self loathing touch.    "
9,13,monica:," ""take me to the mansion in the sky y"". i am sorry, the song is over. did you see me out there?"
9,13,phoebe:, every little bit of you!
9,13,monica:," i cant believe i did this. i cant believe i'm singing for the people, and they liked me! hey, did you hear thatone shouting look at those tips! i mean, did i really help you get a lot of tips?"
9,13,mike:, sure.
9,13,phoebe:," mon', not that you didnt sound good, but..."
9,13,monica:, good? didnt you hear them...i was great! thank you so much for making me do this. thats is the best gift ever.
9,13,mike:, also a good gift? underwear.    
9,13,michelle:," thank you so much for letting me do this. public bathrooms freak me out, i can't even pee, let alone doanything else."
9,13,ross:," but, whats great is that you dont mind talking about it."
9,13,michelle:," its so amazing i met you the same day that eric broke up with me, because its like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend."
9,13,ross:, uh ah!
9,13,michelle:," no dont worry, this is not some rebound thing. i am totally over eric."
9,13,ross:, . good choice ross.
9,13,rachel:," oh, hey! hi, there you are, ive been looking for you everywhere!"
9,13,ross:," oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am."
9,13,rachel:," listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o clock. so i was hoping you and i could have achance to kind of talk¦ somebody here?"
9,13,ross:," oh, yeah, yeah thats michelle."
9,13,rachel:, who?
9,13,ross:," oh, just this woman ive been seeing."
9,13,rachel:, youve being seeing someone?
9,13,ross:," yeah, didnt i mention that? yeah, i mean, we havent being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. i i mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. i thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice."
9,13,michelle:, what are you taking amoxicillin for?
9,13,ross:," how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, thatsmy roommate, rachel."
9,13,rachel:," hi, and i am also emmas mother."
9,13,michelle:," ah, who is emma?"
9,13,ross:, i told you about my daughter.
9,13,michelle:, this is your daughter? i can be your new mummy!    
9,13,chandler:, and done!
9,13,joey:," oh my god! i didnt feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon"
9,13,chandler:, thanks. you wanna see what it looks like?
9,13,joey:," yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look great! how you doing!"
9,13,chandler:," yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate."
9,13,joey:, thank you so much.
9,13,chandler:, no problem.
9,13,joey:," listen thats a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."
9,13,chandler:, yeah.
9,13,joey:, comb my eyelashes.    
9,13,monica:," ok, for my next song i think ill sing something a little more upbeat. all right? oh, how about the pointersisters i am so excited. and make it bouncy!"
9,13,phoebe:, oh youll probably take care of that on your hands.
9,13,chandler:, i am sorry i am late. youll understand when youll see joey.
9,13,monica:," honey, youre just in time, im about to sing another song!"
9,13,chandler:, really? in front of all this people?
9,13,monica:, and they love me!
9,13,chandler:, oh my god!
9,13,phoebe:," yes, she gives the people what they want."
9,13,monica:," all right, watch!"
9,13,monica:," ""tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. give in thistime and show me some affection..."""
9,13,chandler:, are those my wifes nipples?
9,13,phoebe:," oh? isnt that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have let her go up again."
9,13,chandler:, i gotta stop this.
9,13,monica:," oh, who cares, they still love me! ""i am so excited..."""
9,13,chandler:," you, touching yourself, out!    "
9,13,rachel:, wow. she does that a lot!
9,13,michelle:," ross, you didnt tell me you were a doctor!"
9,13,rachel:," what, what, wait a minute! you havent even told her you were a doctor, yet? how long have you known her, likean hour?"
9,13,michelle:, actually about an hour and a half.
9,13,ross:," i told you it wasnt long, but there is an amazing connection between us."
9,13,michelle:," you feel that too? oh, i thought that was just me!"
9,13,ross:, are you kidding?
9,13,michelle:," hey, do you want to go away this weekend?"
9,13,ross:, well see.
9,13,rachel:," ok, ross, whats going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?"
9,13,ross:," i dont know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?"
9,13,rachel:, how do you know about that?
9,13,ross:," through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to sleep..."
9,13,michelle:, emma.
9,13,ross:," when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know, for what? a week?"
9,13,rachel:," oh, thats what this is all about? did you bring her up here to get back at me?"
9,13,michelle:," no, actually, see i had to pee, cause i cant use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites."
9,13,ross:," ok, michelle, its time to go."
9,13,michelle:," well, call me!"
9,13,ross:, ok.
9,13,michelle:," no, wait, you dont have my phone number!"
9,13,ross:," you know, if its meant to be, ill guess it. bye, bye."
9,13,rachel:, score.
9,13,ross:," oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony."
9,13,rachel:," oh god, i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this. it was one kiss, one guy, one time!"
9,13,ross:," oh, really!"
9,13,rachel:, yeah.
9,13,ross:," oh, really!"
9,13,rachel:, oh yeah.
9,13,ross:, what about the guy from the bar?
9,13,rachel:, what? who?
9,13,ross:, the guy you gave your number to.
9,13,rachel:," whoa, how do you know about that?"
9,13,ross:," because he called here looking for you. so dont tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me."
9,13,rachel:, why didnt i get that message?
9,13,ross:, what?
9,13,rachel:," from the guy in the bar, why didnt i get that message?"
9,13,ross:, because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you not look there?
9,13,rachel:, ross?
9,13,ross:, i never gave it to you.
9,13,rachel:, why?
9,13,ross:, i dont know.
9,13,rachel:, oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get?
9,13,ross:, who am i?
9,13,rachel:, yes.
9,13,ross:, i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys!
9,13,rachel:," oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youabout us! but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!"
9,13,ross:, none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! thats not the point. ok? the point is you...you are the onewho moved on and didnt tell anyone!
9,13,rachel:," oh, ross, this is just so messed up! whats wrong with us? you know when people hear about our situation theyalways ask, what, you live together but youre not a couple? and you have a baby, isnt that weird?» and i say no.you know what, its not, because it works for us!» but you know this doesnt work. in fact this is the opposite of working!"
9,13,ross:," uh, clearly."
9,13,rachel:," and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know,just doesnt make sense anymore."
9,13,ross:," yeah, maybe not. so what you wanna do?    "
9,13,joey:, hey!
9,13,rachel:, hi. can emma and i live here for a while?
9,13,joey:," ha, oh, of course."
9,13,rachel:, thank you.
9,13,joey:, your eyebrows look weird.    
9,13,chandler:," jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but i helped himdrink his wine. so you just touch yourself for anything?    "
9,14,joey:," morning, roomie!"
9,14,rachel:, hey! you remembered to put clothes on this morning.
9,14,joey:, fifth day's a charm.
9,14,rachel:," oh, joey, it's so great to be back here. i gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and emma."
9,14,joey:," hey, it's great having you back. you know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night? "
9,14,ross:," hey, you're not naked! so hey, rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?"
9,14,rachel:," well, i'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. but she did actually fall back to sleep, so..."
9,14,joey:, she's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
9,14,rachel:, bye! 
9,14,ross:," bye! hey, i hope emma isn't making it too hard on you."
9,14,joey:," no, hey, it's been great."
9,14,ross:, yeah?
9,14,joey:," yeah. and look, i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? and even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump..."
9,14,ross:," yeah, that'll do it."
9,14,joey:," wow! so, how are you?"
9,14,ross:," i'm, i'm okay. "
9,14,joey:, really?
9,14,ross:," sure, i mean, do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out? of course. you know, i'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce."
9,14,joey:," well, actually it..."
9,14,ross:," no, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! anyway, i think rachel and i need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people."
9,14,joey:," wow, really?"
9,14,ross:," yeah, sure, why not? in fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me..."
9,14,joey:," sure, i know lots of girls. "
9,14,ross:, yeah? any names come to mind?
9,14,joey:," ooh, names? opening credits. "
9,14,phoebe:, hey.
9,14,joey:, hey. i was just gonna get something to eat. you want something?
9,14,phoebe:," okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... ooh! strained plums. we haven't tried that yet."
9,14,phoebe:," goodie! thanks. so, how is it living with rachel again? i mean, apart from the great food."
9,14,joey:," i'm fine, i'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and ross. you know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
9,14,phoebe:," oh my god, rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too."
9,14,joey:, why are they doing this?
9,14,phoebe:, i don't know. they're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
9,14,joey:," you know what's crazy? these jars. what is it, like two bites in here?"
9,14,phoebe:, i just wish they'd realise they should be together.
9,14,joey:," i know, i know. and when they moved back in together, i figured y'know, that's where things were headed."
9,14,phoebe:, i know. they should be a family. they should get married and have more children.
9,14,joey:," yes, and they should name one of their kids joey. i may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
9,14,phoebe:," you know what? maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
9,14,joey:, yuck! but we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
9,14,phoebe:," so, what are we gonna do? are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?"
9,14,joey:, i know; that just pushes them further and further apart. 
9,14,phoebe:," yeah. oh, i know what we can do. we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
9,14,joey:," ooh, that's a great plan! "
9,14,phoebe:," yeah, you know what the best part of it is? i get to do my ""plan laugh."" "
9,14,joey:," shhh! not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh... "
9,14,rachel:, hey!
9,14,monica:, hey!
9,14,rachel:," you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
9,14,chandler:," see, now, why would you assume that? just because we're married? i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries."
9,14,rachel:, i was just asking 'cause i need someone to watch emma tonight.
9,14,monica:," sure, we'll do that. what are you up to?"
9,14,rachel:," well, phoebe set me up on a date. "
9,14,monica:, oh my god.
9,14,chandler:, wow.
9,14,rachel:, why? what's the big deal?
9,14,monica:," just figured, 'cause you and ross are..."
9,14,rachel:," what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, i'm all set."
9,14,chandler:," well, i think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? i mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood!"
9,14,monica:," you want a job? turn off ""oprah,"" and send out a resume!"
9,14,rachel:, so i'll bring her by around seven? is that okay?
9,14,monica:," oh, it's perfect."
9,14,rachel:, suddenly i wish i was reading my own name. 
9,14,phoebe:," ooh, joey. "
9,14,joey:, hey.
9,14,phoebe:, hey. i'm so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight. 
9,14,joey:, all right! who is he?
9,14,phoebe:," okay, okay. wait till you hear who i got for ross."
9,14,phoebe:," oh, yeah. "
9,14,joey:, she's this really boring woman. she's a teacher! 
9,14,phoebe:, a teacher?
9,14,joey:," yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... and oh, oh, she loves puzzles. huh? come on, who loves puzzles?"
9,14,phoebe:," well, ross does. what... you're you're ruining the plan! joey, you've you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! "
9,14,joey:," oh my god, you're right! "
9,14,phoebe:, yeah.
9,14,joey:, she even reads for pleasure!
9,14,phoebe:, how do you even know a woman like that?
9,14,joey:, what? i'm not allowed to know smart women? 
9,14,phoebe:, joey.
9,14,joey:, i met her at the library. i went in to pee.
9,14,phoebe:, so now what do we do?
9,14,joey:," well, okay, i'll i'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else."
9,14,phoebe:," what if we don't find him somebody else? we'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!"
9,14,joey:, ooh...i hear that's bad. 
9,14,phoebe:," ooh, so this is great! rachel's gonna have a terrible date, ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
9,14,joey:," ah, yes, the plan! "
9,14,phoebe:," it's not santa's plan. no, it's... "
9,14,joey:," yeah, you know, it's not that fun."
9,14,phoebe:," no, i think we killed it. "
9,14,chandler:," emma? emma? look at me! well, i think i'll go downstairs for a while. "
9,14,chandler:," no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it's okay, it's okay. i didn't go. don't cry, it's just a bit! i'm your uncle chandler; funny is all i have! "
9,14,monica:," okay, just so you know, i'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours."
9,14,chandler:, i don't do that. 
9,14,chandler:," i'll try to stop. wait, did you say until the sixth?"
9,14,monica:, yeah.
9,14,chandler:, today is the sixth.
9,14,monica:," no, it's not. "
9,14,chandler:," yes, it's also 2003."
9,14,monica:, oh my god. today's the sixth?! i may be done ovulating! i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
9,14,chandler:, it's okay. go take the test and see if we're okay.
9,14,monica:, okay. 
9,14,chandler:, tough crib.
9,14,monica:," hey, where are all my ovulation sticks? there's only one here."
9,14,chandler:, i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times.
9,14,monica:, chandler!
9,14,chandler:, i am not working. there's not much to do around here! 
9,14,ross:," excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?"
9,14,waiter:," uh, there's a drunk chinese guy."
9,14,ross:," well, if i'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me."
9,14,waiter:, can i get you another glass of wine? 
9,14,ross:," nah, i don't know if i should. i don't wanna be drunk when i go home alone."
9,14,waiter:," got stood up, huh?"
9,14,ross:," yeah, it's no big deal. it's just a blind date."
9,14,waiter:," are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?"
9,14,ross:, no! 
9,14,monica:, we're okay. i'm still ovulating.
9,14,chandler:," oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, i am not. "
9,14,monica:," so, let's do this."
9,14,chandler:, i i don't think i can.
9,14,monica:," come on. i know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
9,14,chandler:, because of emma.
9,14,monica:," oh my god, emma. oh, sweetie, i forgot you were here. oh, you're right, we can't do this. we can't leave her alone."
9,14,chandler:, sorry.
9,14,monica:," unless... maybe we do it here. i mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?"
9,14,chandler:," well, she's aware when we leave the room. she may notice if we start... canoodling in it."
9,14,monica:, canoodling?
9,14,chandler:," well, i can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the b a b y."
9,14,monica:," i don't know. i mean, i guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so..."
9,14,chandler:, horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for?
9,14,monica:, i guess you're right.
9,14,chandler:," you guess i'm right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window."
9,14,monica:, but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer? 
9,14,rachel:, i i just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
9,14,rachel:," oh, well, that's that's very sweet. thank you."
9,14,steve:, i'm kind of funny looking. 
9,14,rachel:, what?
9,14,steve:," so, what do think you wanna order? i'm really excited about that chicken."
9,14,steve:," i'm not funny either. so, if you were thinking, ""well, he's not that good looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs""... that ain't gonna happen."
9,14,rachel:," well, come on, steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. hey, now wait a minute. phoebe told me that that you owned your own restaurant. that's impressive."
9,14,steve:, i lost it. to drugs. 
9,14,steve:, i silk screen t shirts now.
9,14,rachel:, really? what's that like?
9,14,steve:," now, come on, come on, steve. there must be something that you like about yourself. "
9,14,steve:, i do like my hair.
9,14,rachel:, really? 
9,14,phoebe:, hello? 
9,14,rachel:," phoebe, it's me. i'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
9,14,phoebe:," hey, rach!"
9,14,rachel:, this is the worst date ever. how could you set me up with this creep?
9,14,phoebe:," you know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. "
9,14,rachel:, i don't care! this guy is a nightmare!
9,14,phoebe:," oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
9,14,rachel:, he's not stoned.
9,14,phoebe:, did he go out for a cigarette? 
9,14,rachel:," yeah, four times."
9,14,phoebe:," well, our plan is working. rachel is having a miserable time, and ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone."
9,14,joey:," oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
9,14,phoebe:," by the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny mexico. oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan. "
9,14,monica:, she's asleep. chandler? 
9,14,monica:, what are you doing?
9,14,chandler:, emma was doing it!
9,14,monica:, she's asleep.
9,14,chandler:," ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
9,14,monica:," okay, i'll try. "
9,14,joey:, hello? 
9,14,joey:, emma? hey! hi! 
9,14,joey:," how are ya? how are ya? where are your babysitters, huh? why's the bedroom door closed? "
9,14,joey:," you can't have s e x, when you're taking care of the b a b i e! "
9,14,waiter:, i've got bad news. the chinese guy left. 
9,14,ross:," eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."
9,14,waiter:," look; you got stood up, who cares? we're gonna show you a good time. just sit and relax. in fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house."
9,14,ross:," wow, free crab cakes. well, that's nice. although i was hoping to have sex tonight."
9,14,waiter:, ooh... 
9,14,ross:, what are you doing? are you trying to get him to stay? because you can't do that.
9,14,waiter:," just get out of here, okay?"
9,14,ross:, what's what's going on?
9,14,waiter:," eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. we have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home."
9,14,ross:, what? you you're making money off my misery?
9,14,waiter:," well, if you stay till 9 , i am."
9,14,ross:," this is unbelievable. i i have never been so insulted in my life. now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, i'll be on my way. "
9,14,monica:," well, that was weird. you were loud, and i was fast."
9,14,chandler:, i think we may have really done it this time.
9,14,monica:," oh, i wish i didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
9,14,chandler:, you may wanna get some more of those too. 
9,14,chandler:, where's emma?
9,14,monica:," oh my god, where's emma? where's emma?"
9,14,chandler:," don't ask me, i was in there canoodling you!"
9,14,monica:," okay, okay, i'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma. you go look across the hall, and i'll call her cell."
9,14,chandler:, okay. 
9,14,monica:, i i can't believe im crying in front of you. you must think i'm so pathetic.
9,14,rachel:," no, no, no, i admire a man who can cry."
9,14,steve:, really? 
9,14,rachel:, don't touch my coat! 
9,14,rachel:," hey, rach, how's it going?"
9,14,rachel:," look, you know what, i'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? what's up?"
9,14,monica:," hey, did you stop by here?"
9,14,rachel:, no.
9,14,monica:," oh my god, then... "
9,14,monica:," oh, thank god! emma, there you are!"
9,14,rachel:," what? what do you mean, ""there you are""? where was she?"
9,14,monica:, why the hell did you take her?
9,14,joey:, because you two were having sex!
9,14,monica:," no, we weren't!"
9,14,joey:, don't you lie to me! i could tell by chandler's hair. you are so lazy. can't you get on top for once?
9,14,chandler:," all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating."
9,14,joey:, hey! it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room. i'm gonna have to tell rachel about this. 
9,14,chandler:," no, no, no."
9,14,monica:," no, please don't. please, joey. she will kill us!"
9,14,joey:," hey, i gotta! unless..."
9,14,monica:, unless what?
9,14,joey:, unless you name your firstborn child joey.
9,14,chandler:, what? why?
9,14,joey:," hey, i may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name."
9,14,chandler:, your family name is tribbiani.
9,14,joey:, you almost had me. 
9,14,rachel:," well, uh..."
9,14,steve:," look, i think i know the answer to this question, but... would you like to make love to me?"
9,14,rachel:," really, really not."
9,14,steve:," eh, it's just as well. doesn't work anyway."
9,14,rachel:," all right, well that's good to know. good night, steve. "
9,14,ross:," hey, what's wrong?"
9,14,rachel:, i just had a rough night.
9,14,ross:, oh. crab cake?
9,14,rachel:, eww!
9,14,ross:," well, what happened?"
9,14,rachel:," oh, well, i...it's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
9,14,ross:, monica told me you had a blind date.
9,14,rachel:, yeah.
9,14,ross:," i did, too."
9,14,rachel:, oh.
9,14,ross:, but is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
9,14,rachel:," oh, oh no. do you think she walked in, saw you and left?"
9,14,ross:, why does everyone keep saying that?
9,14,rachel:," well, if it makes you feel any better, i wish my date hadn't shown up."
9,14,ross:, that bad?
9,14,rachel:," well, he makes t shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this. "
9,14,ross:, female body inspector? what size is that? 
9,14,phoebe:," now, wait a minute. so, they're gonna name their first child joey?"
9,14,joey:, uh huh.
9,14,phoebe:, how how do i get them to name the next one after me?
9,14,joey:," it's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
9,14,phoebe:," oh, so they owe me like, three phoebes. "
9,14,phoebe:," oh my god! look, it's ross and rachel. oh, the plan is working. "
9,14,phoebe:," don't, don't do the plan laugh. "
9,14,ross:," the first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
9,14,rachel:," oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show."
9,14,ross:," wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? i mean, that's just stupid. "
9,14,joey:," we're geniuses! yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding."
9,14,phoebe:," oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again. "
9,14,phoebe:," oh, they see us! oh, they, they look mad. oh, they figured it out. they're coming this way. run!"
9,14,joey:, where?
9,14,phoebe:, mexico! end credits. 
9,14,joey:, can you believe they're still not here?
9,14,ross:," i know. a double blind date, and we both get stood up. what are the chances?"
9,14,joey:," i know, i'm so bummed. can we have our free crab cakes now?"
9,14,waiter:, what?
9,14,joey:, we've been stood up. and we want our free crab cakes.
9,14,waiter:," guys, give it a rest. nobody's betting on you tonight. although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry. "
9,14,steve:, i have such fat hands!
9,15,chandler:," guys, guys, i've got great news! guess what '"
9,15,joey:," uh, ah, monica's pregnant?!"

9,15,chandler:," actually, it pays nothing. it's an internship."
9,15,joey:," oh, that's cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'. "
9,15,chandler:," right. so, it'll be the same except ' less sex with you. "
9,15,ross:," so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"
9,15,chandler:," well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
9,15,phoebe:, that's great.
9,15,chandler:," yeah, i mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating "
9,15,chandler:, humiliating and noble! 
9,15,ross:," you know, if i didn't already have a job, i think, i would have been really good in advertising."

9,15,monica:, what happened?
9,15,joey:," well, he said i wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical. oh, and he said that i should think less."
9,15,monica:, so far so good! 
9,15,chandler:," honey, i'm old!"
9,15,monica:, what's wrong?
9,15,chandler:, i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them.
9,15,monica:, you have all this life experience.
9,15,chandler:," yes, but i don't think life experience with these. "
9,15,joey:, wooooooooow it's like they're on fire!
9,15,monica:, what are they? 
9,15,chandler:, they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self respecting adult would ever where these.
9,15,joey:, i give you $ 500 for them!
9,15,chandler:, what am i supposed to do with these?
9,15,monica:," ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time."
9,15,chandler:," they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! would you help me try to sell these?"
9,15,monica:," okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? "
9,15,chandler:," no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. "
9,15,joey:," hey, that'd work on me! why did i get to buy mrs. butterwords? "
9,15,all:," hey, hey!"
9,15,ross:," hey, you'll never guess what just happened ' phoebe and i got mugged!"
9,15,monica:, you okay?!
9,15,ross:," yah, because phoebe knew the mugger! "
9,15,monica:, how do you know a mugger?
9,15,phoebe:, i'm sorry i have friends outside the six of us. 
9,15,ross:, you wanna know how she knew him? because phoebe used to mug people. 
9,15,monica:, seriously?
9,15,phoebe:," well, i'm not proud of it, but, you know ' sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i '"
9,15,monica:," phoebe, that is awful!"
9,15,phoebe:," well, ok, i wasn't rich like you guys, ok, i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony ' i had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer '"
9,15,monica:, you're mother killed herself!
9,15,phoebe:, she was a drug dealer!
9,15,ross:," well, anyway, it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him, because i was about to do some serious damage! "
9,15,phoebe:, okay '
9,15,monica:," well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, ross."
9,15,phoebe:, why?

9,15,joey:, probably wanna know what i'm doing '?
9,15,monica:," no, that seems about right."
9,15,joey:," yesterday at my audition, i really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. i got a call back, so i'm drinking everything. oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"
9,15,rachel:," joey, that was formula."
9,15,joey:, we gotta get more of that. 
9,15,chandler:, you know what ' these aren't half bad! you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren.
9,15,rachel:," okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph. "
9,15,chandler:, alright i feel youger already! 
9,15,chandler:," yah, i think i broke my hip. "
9,15,phoebe:," hey, you!"
9,15,ross:, hey!
9,15,phoebe:," hey, how was class?"
9,15,ross:," no one ever asked me that, what's wrong? "
9,15,phoebe:," nothing, i really wanna know."
9,15,ross:," oh ' well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene '"
9,15,phoebe:," alright, nothing is worth this. uhm, i have a confession to make ' uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid '"
9,15,ross:, wh what are you talking about? it wasn't a girl. it was this huge dude.
9,15,phoebe:," you don't have to lie anymore, ross, i know that it was a fourteen year old girl."
9,15,ross:," no, it wasn't."
9,15,phoebe:," yes, it was. "
9,15,ross:," no, it wasn't. you don't think i would've defended myself against a fourteen year old '"
9,15,phoebe:," ""gimme your money, punk!"""
9,15,ross:," oh my god, it was you! i can't believe it, you ' you mugged me? "
9,15,phoebe:," yeah, and i'm so, so sorry, ross, i'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. i mean, well, it's just that i i've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and i have ' have a great one! "
9,15,ross:, it's not the best!
9,15,phoebe:," i know, i'm sorry, please forgive me. i don't know what to say '"
9,15,ross:, there's nothing you can say. that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. 
9,15,phoebe:, really? even more humiliating than '
9,15,ross:," hey, let's not do this! "
9,15,intern:," ' and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!"
9,15,boss:, you didn't mention the shoes. who's next? chander '
9,15,chandler:, okay ' you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. he's about my age '
9,15,intern:, your age?
9,15,chandler:," ""not suitable for adults!"" "
9,15,boss:," chandler, that's great! "
9,15,chandler:," oh, thank you, sir ' or man who's two years younger than me "
9,15,boss:," you see? that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic, it's '. you did you come up with that?"
9,15,chandler:," i don't know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow."
9,15,boss:, that is great. good work! chandler. thank you. 
9,15,boss:, see all of you tomorrow. 
9,15,chandler:, the cold weather hurts my hip! 
9,15,phoebe:," hey, ross! i know you're still mad at me, but can i just talk to you for a second? "
9,15,ross:," sure, go ahead. whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. "
9,15,phoebe:, i just really wanted to apologize again and ' and also show you something i think you'll find very exciting. 
9,15,ross:," oh my god, crap from the street? "
9,15,phoebe:," look, ross, in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell ' or smoke. anyway, i was looking through it and i found ""science boy"" "
9,15,ross:, oh my god. i never thought i'd see this again. it's all here. what made you save it all these years? 
9,15,phoebe:," i can't say, i just thought it was really good ' and ' maybe would be worth something some day. "
9,15,ross:," you really thought ""science boy"" was worth saving! "
9,15,phoebe:," yeah ' but you should know, i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. "
9,15,ross:," still ' this is amazing ' oh my god, thank you, phoebe. "
9,15,phoebe:," you're welcome. and thank you for ""science boy"". i learned a lot from him "
9,15,ross:, you're welcome. 
9,15,joey:," ""i need an answer!"""

9,15,lennart:," ""i don't know!"""
9,15,joey:," ""i need an answer now!"" "
9,15,lennart:," ""alright, here, you want an answer ' the answer ' is '"" "
9,15,joey:, oh!
9,15,lennart:," ""she never loved me, she only loved you."""
9,15,joey:," ""you knew this all along and you never told me? you never told me? i can never forgive you, i can never forgive myself, i have nothing to live for  bang  end scene!"""
9,15,lennart:, absolutely amazing! the part is yours. 
9,15,joey:," oh thanks, thanks! now, i really have to get '"

9,15,monica:," wow, that's a big cable bill! huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn ' on a saturday afternoon?! i was in the house! "
9,15,ross:," hey, uhm, phoebe didn't by any chance mention that '"
9,15,monica:, ' that she was the huge guy that mugged you? yah. 
9,15,ross:, i see. you didn't happen to tell '
9,15,monica:, ' everybody we know? yeah.
9,15,ross:, great. thanks! 
9,16,chandler:, did you see our bank statement? can this be right?
9,16,monica:, i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double stuffed oreos. what happened to all our money?
9,16,chandler:," i'm not sure what they did, but i'm inclined to blame enron."
9,16,monica:," i guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in."
9,16,chandler:, maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
9,16,monica:," oh, but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask you to give that up. though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold."
9,16,chandler:, you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change. you're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
9,16,monica:, ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
9,16,chandler:, no! we're not borrowing money.
9,16,monica:, why not?
9,16,chandler:, because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
9,16,monica:, wow! i had no idea you had this much pride.
9,16,chandler:, that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard. opening credits 
9,16,mike:, i'm gonna go. 
9,16,phoebe:, why??
9,16,mike:, i haven't been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more clothes.
9,16,phoebe:," oh...you don't have to go, i have something that will fit you."
9,16,mike:, i put that tube top on as a joke.
9,16,phoebe:, i want you to stay.
9,16,mike:, i want to stay too but i've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as i can..
9,16,phoebe:, why don't you turn them inside ou...
9,16,mike:, done it. i'll be back in a couple of hours.
9,16,phoebe:, i'll miss you.
9,16,mike:, me too. you know what? i just realised something. i don't wanna go home.
9,16,phoebe:, great! ok...i'll go get the tube top.
9,16,mike:," no, no! what i mean is, i hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because i live above a known crack den but... mostly because when i'm there, it's just, i really miss you. so.. do you want to move in together?"
9,16,phoebe:," wow, mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say ""hell yeah!"""
9,16,mike:, so we're doing it?
9,16,phoebe:," yeah! let's do it! let's live together! oh god, we're really going to move in together!"
9,16,mike:, yeah!
9,16,phoebe:," i've always wanted to live with a guy. ""pick up your socks!"" ""put down the toilet seat!"" ""no! we're not having sex anymore!"" it's gonna be fun! "
9,16,monica:, hey joey!
9,16,joey:, hey!
9,16,monica:," listen...i need to know that what i'm about to ask you, will never get back to chandler. "
9,16,joey:," i'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about it myself. chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. good... ...but wrong."
9,16,monica:, ok first of all...it would be great. but that's not what i'm here to talk to you about. i need to borrow some money.
9,16,joey:," aww, i don't know monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake."
9,16,monica:, but chandler lent you money!
9,16,joey:, and i think he would tell you it was a mistake.
9,16,monica:, come on...i just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
9,16,joey:, oh...how much?
9,16,monica:, two thousand dollars?
9,16,joey:, two thousand dollars!? what do you think i am? i soap opera star!?
9,16,monica:, yeah...
9,16,joey:, that's right i am! 
9,16,rachel:, hey!
9,16,joey:, oo...what's in the bag?
9,16,rachel:," oh er... well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby proof the apartment."
9,16,joey:," oh...baby proofing... why is this such a big deal now? y'know, when i was a kid it was like.. ""whoops! joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""whoops! joey electrocuted himself again!"" huh!"
9,16,monica:," anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?"
9,16,rachel:, no. i was just going to do this myself. 
9,16,joey:, you're gonna do it?
9,16,rachel:," yeah, why? you don't think a woman can do this?"
9,16,joey:," oh, women can. you can't."
9,16,rachel:, monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig?
9,16,monica:, you're a pig. and you can't do this.
9,16,rachel:, wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself!
9,16,joey:, the hardware store is right down the street.
9,16,rachel:, there is a hardware store right down the street? 
9,16,phoebe:," hey you guys! ok, we've got great news."
9,16,mike:, congratulations!/good for you!/great!
9,16,phoebe:, i know it's so exciting! you know i've never lived with a guy before.
9,16,monica:," well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't steal your makeup. unless they're playing ""this is what my sister would look like"" "
9,16,chandler:, yeah.... she's not so cute.
9,16,mike:, i'm gonna go to the bathroom.
9,16,phoebe:," okay, well you put down the toilet seat."
9,16,mike:, yes dear.
9,16,monica:, is that a bit you guys do?
9,16,phoebe:, uh huh...we're playing you two.
9,16,monica:, we don't do that! tell her we don't do that!
9,16,chandler:, yes dear.
9,16,ross:," i can't believe you guys are moving in together. that's, that's great! i mean...i'm happy for you guys.."
9,16,monica:, i hear wedding bells.
9,16,phoebe:," monica slow down! ok? i'm just excited to be living with him. you know i mean, i don't know, can i see someday being married to mike? sure! yeah. y'know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that house in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do."
9,16,ross:," phoebe, i had no idea you were so conventional."
9,16,phoebe:, i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom!
9,16,mike:, you ready to go?
9,16,phoebe:, yeah! you bet roomy!
9,16,monica:, don't you mean..groomy?
9,16,mike:, what are you talking about?
9,16,phoebe:," oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. "
9,16,phoebe:, china patterns!!!!! 
9,16,rachel:, this is easy...can't do this! oh! wow! seriously i can't do this. 
9,16,chandler:, hey joe!
9,16,joey:, hey!
9,16,chandler:, listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything about it.
9,16,joey:, i thought you didn't have secrets from monica.
9,16,chandler:, and that would have made the official party line. monica and i are having a little financial trouble.
9,16,joey:," yeah, i know."
9,16,chandler:, what? what do you mean you know?
9,16,joey:," err... i just figured it out! you know, i mean you're not working and the economy is bad."
9,16,chandler:, oh! right.
9,16,joey:, that's the fastest i have ever thought!
9,16,chandler:," anyway, err... i need to borrow some money."
9,16,joey:, oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars?
9,16,chandler:, yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that! 
9,16,joey:, err...well i...know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is. 
9,16,chandler:, oh ok.
9,16,joey:, listen...this is really nice. do you... did you write a cheque to monica for two thousand dollars? did monica borrow money from you?
9,16,joey:, err... kind of.
9,16,chandler:, i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems?
9,16,joey:," oh no no no no no... it wasn't... it wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her."
9,16,chandler:, what?
9,16,joey:, something personal.
9,16,chandler:, what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about? 
9,16,woman:, excuse me.
9,16,joey:, boob job.
9,16,monica:, i don't want her to get a boob job! that's crazy!
9,16,joey:," well it's...it's not that crazy okay? making them smaller, that would be crazy. "
9,16,mike:," well hey, i wanna ask you about monica's little ""groomy"" joke."
9,16,phoebe:, oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
9,16,mike:," i get the joke. sophisticated as it was. now the thing i wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?"
9,16,phoebe:, oh no! no no! not at all. we're just moving in right now. see where it goes.
9,16,mike:," yeah well, that's the thing. for me it's as far as it can ever go."
9,16,phoebe:, what do you mean?
9,16,mike:," look. phoebe, i i love you. very much. but i never want to get married again."
9,16,phoebe:, oh. wow.
9,16,mike:," it's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. i kind of lost faith in the whole idea."
9,16,phoebe:, was it really that bad?
9,16,mike:, at one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
9,16,phoebe:," ok, well that's bad. but don't you think it might be different with someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once in the ocean."
9,16,mike:, look it's not about who i would marry. and i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever. and i was totally wrong!
9,16,phoebe:, but it's just...
9,16,mike:," look phoebe, it's not about you. i just never wanna get married again."
9,16,phoebe:, oh!
9,16,mike:, i'm sorry. are you ok with that? cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
9,16,phoebe:, no! i definitely don't wanna get married. no i just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
9,16,mike:," trust me, i will never..."
9,16,phoebe:, yeah i get that. 
9,16,rachel:, hi!
9,16,monica:, so you gave in and decided to call someone?
9,16,rachel:," yeah, i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks."
9,16,handyman:, you're all set. 
9,16,rachel:, oh thank you so much. oh oh wait! you forgot your erm...your game. 
9,16,handyman:, thanks..... 
9,16,chandler:, hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.
9,16,rachel:, don't look at me i never get his jokes.
9,16,monica:, thank you?
9,16,chandler:, oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one thing i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not... two... single things.
9,16,monica:," ok, you're being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something bad?"
9,16,chandler:," no no! i just love the way you look, i am warm, for your form."
9,16,monica:," ok..you know the old classics you know,you look nice? they're still ok."
9,16,chandler:," well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks nice. i want to compliment your body. i mean..i wouldn't change it. at all. and more specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
9,16,monica:, okay...
9,16,chandler:," i mean, you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? don't answer that. "
9,16,rachel:, just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
9,16,monica:, i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
9,16,rachel:," i don't know! i mean, what brought that on?"
9,16,monica:, oh my god. we're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
9,16,rachel:, no you really think that's what it is?
9,16,monica:," you heard him! ""no bigger!"" ""you're perfect!"" ""just don't get any bigger!"" oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. you know what? i'm going to have to talk to chandler."
9,16,rachel:," yeah! if you don't i will! of course your body's gonna change. your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. god! it's just such a magical time! "
9,16,phoebe:, hi
9,16,ross:, hey!
9,16,phoebe:," listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage."
9,16,ross:, oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? i mean i can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
9,16,phoebe:, no...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.
9,16,ross:, why?
9,16,phoebe:, mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
9,16,ross:, never?
9,16,phoebe:, never.
9,16,ross:," wow, are you still going to move in with him?"
9,16,phoebe:," i want to, but i just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. you know that i won't, i won't be missing out on anything. that marriage stinks!"
9,16,ross:," yeah, marriage... stinks! i mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? get them married."
9,16,phoebe:, that's not how you really feel is it?
9,16,ross:," no, i'm sorry. look i don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but i can't help it. i love marriage."
9,16,phoebe:, seriously? you divorce o?
9,16,ross:," if you have to call me name, i prefer ""ross the divorcer"". it's just cooler. look, i know my marriage isn't exactly work out. but i love to be that committed to another person. and carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. i'm sorry."
9,16,phoebe:, it's ok that's how you feel.
9,16,ross:, but come on! i mean living together will be great! i mean you guys have so much fun and you love mike.
9,16,phoebe:, i do love mike.
9,16,ross:," yeah see? and you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? you should be. it's a big deal!"
9,16,phoebe:, yeah i guess you're right. yeah thanks. this helped. thanks.
9,16,ross:," the divorcer, to the rescue!"
9,16,phoebe:, it's not cooler.
9,16,ross:, yeah i just hurt it. 
9,16,joey:, rach?! rachel!!!!? so i can't do anything i like????

9,16,chandler:, god why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
9,16,monica:, i thought i was something that we both wanted!
9,16,chandler:," alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
9,16,rachel:," oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?"
9,16,chandler:, what? 
9,16,rachel:, joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job?
9,16,joey:, because she is!
9,16,monica:," joey, chandler knows i borrowed the money."
9,16,joey:, it's over/joe!
9,16,joey:, ok so i'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

9,16,phoebe:," oh yeah you were helpful! yeah, no, thanks you."
9,16,ross:," good, good. yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised i don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."
9,16,phoebe:, what do you mean?
9,16,ross:," well, i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo?"
9,16,phoebe:, they are awfully boxy...
9,16,ross:, i don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. i mean it's so... normal.
9,16,phoebe:, uh huh. 
9,16,ross:," hey hey, can i help?"
9,16,chandler:," well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky."
9,16,ross:, you know sometimes your words... they hurt.
9,16,joey:," hey uh, where do you guys want this?"
9,16,rachel:," yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. i mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys."
9,16,phoebe:, just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? none at all?
9,16,mike:, no but... you don't want to get married either right?
9,16,phoebe:, right. except that i do want to get married.
9,16,joey:, couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
9,16,mike:, you wanna get married?
9,16,phoebe:, someday.
9,16,chandler:, aaaaand....... hernia.
9,16,phoebe:, i haven't exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
9,16,mike:, but if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
9,16,phoebe:," because i just didn't know how much i wanted it. and i love you, and i wanted to live with you."
9,16,mike:, i want to live with you too! let's do that!
9,16,phoebe:," but i don't think i can! it was ok to move in when i didn't know what was gonna happen, but i can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
9,16,mike:, can we at least try living together? i mean you might change your mind about marriage.
9,16,phoebe:, are you gonna change yours?
9,16,mike:, no.
9,16,phoebe:, me neither. i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want.
9,16,mike:, but i don't want this to end.
9,16,phoebe:, i don't want it to end either.
9,16,mike:, i can't believe this is gonna end. i guess i'll have my stuff packed up.
9,16,phoebe:, yeah.

9,17,chandler:," great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless ."
9,17,ross:, it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich?
9,17,chandler:, the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
9,17,ross:," uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... "
9,17,chandler:, bet she'd sleep with you now... 
9,17,ross:, no... i already e mailed her.

9,17,joey:, aaand send! opening credits 
9,17,rachel:, hey! how was basketball?
9,17,joey:," oh, it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye!"
9,17,rachel:," oh, no! who did that?"
9,17,joey:, chandler... hey... rach... what's hugsy doin' in the crib with emma? 
9,17,rachel:," she was just crawling around and she found him, so i just let her sleep with him. that's all right? isn't it?"
9,17,joey:," oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... i know that!"
9,17,rachel:," joey... are you sure? i mean, i know how much you love him!"
9,17,joey:," rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? i do not love hugsy. i like him a normal amount... "
9,17,rachel:," all right... oh, emma loves him!"
9,17,joey:, why wouldn't she? he's a wonderful person! 
9,17,phoebe:, hi.

9,17,chandler:," oh, i'm so sorry!"
9,17,phoebe:," oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can't think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!! hey monica, i really need your help getting through this... "
9,17,chandler:, you're not gonna need my help?
9,17,phoebe:," well no, when i get to the point where... you know... i'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... i'm gonna come to you."
9,17,chandler:," oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just thought of a fourth "
9,17,phoebe:," ok. i mean i know i did the right thing. you know, mike never wants to get married and i shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon i'm gonna miss him so much. i'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
9,17,monica:," ok, you got it!"
9,17,phoebe:," unless... maybe it's too crazy about this... alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. you know what? forget what i said."
9,17,monica:, really? if that's what you want... 
9,17,phoebe:, that was a test and you just failed.
9,17,monica:, damn it! rookie mistake! 
9,17,ross:, i have sex with dinosaurs??
9,17,chandler:, i believe i read that somewhere!
9,17,ross:," that only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ok? depending on the species i'd have to have a six foot long... it's not funny!!"
9,17,chandler:, i respectfully disagree.
9,17,ross:, i can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
9,17,chandler:, who cares? nobody reads those things
9,17,ross:, you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today.
9,17,chandler:, i don't have a page.
9,17,ross:, oh oh oh! i respectfully disagree!! 
9,17,joey:," look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. it's okay, emma, you stay asleep. "
9,17,rachel:," step away from the crib, i have a weapon!"
9,17,joey:," it's okay, it's okay rach, it's me. put down the scrunchy."
9,17,rachel:, what are you doing?
9,17,joey:," well, i heard emma stirring, so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy."
9,17,rachel:," oh, oh thanks. alright well, now that i'm up i'm going to go to the bathroom."
9,17,joey:, there you go sweetie... this isn't over. 
9,17,monica:," alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... ""gay as the day is long""?"
9,17,chandler:, because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
9,17,monica:, but that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true. 
9,17,chandler:, would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.
9,17,monica:," hello? no, he's not here. yeah, this is his wife. yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. i guess i should have known. yeah, i mean, he just kept making me watch moulin rouge."
9,17,chandler:," hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie! i'm so gonna get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go ."
9,17,monica:, what are you doing?
9,17,chandler:," oh, you'll see my friend. "
9,17,ross:, i'm dead?
9,17,chandler:, and so young.
9,17,ross:, posting that i died? that really isn't funny.
9,17,chandler:," well, how you died was funny."
9,17,ross:," oh please, hit by a blimp?"
9,17,chandler:, it kills over one americans every year.
9,17,ross:," unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think i'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. you're messing with people's feelings here."
9,17,chandler:, you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west!
9,17,ross:," you've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. that's right! your coming out is about to get real graphic. "
9,17,phoebe:," god, i wish mike were here."
9,17,monica:, okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing? 
9,17,monica:," what are you, animals? it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"
9,17,phoebe:," i gotta call him. just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
9,17,monica:," phoebe, that's how it starts. i don't need to eat the cake, i'll just smell the icing... why don't i just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. and next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. phoebe, honey, i know this is hard. look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. and if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. i know that's not what you want. give me your phone."
9,17,phoebe:, here.
9,17,monica:, and now your cell.
9,17,phoebe:, okay 
9,17,monica:, this is your cellphone?
9,17,phoebe:, yes.
9,17,monica:, this is your current cellphone?
9,17,phoebe:," yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
9,17,monica:," phoebe, where's your purse? "
9,17,monica:," no, no! give it to me!"
9,17,phoebe:, you can't have it.
9,17,monica:, give it to me!
9,17,phoebe:, no 
9,17,monica:, i'll go in there.
9,17,phoebe:, oh yeah.
9,17,monica:, phoebe come here 
9,17,monica:, haha!
9,17,phoebe:, damn you monica geller hyphen bing! 
9,17,joey:," hey, look who's here! it's joey, and he brought home a friend."
9,17,rachel:," joey, emma's right here! you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
9,17,joey:," no, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new hugsy!"
9,17,rachel:," oh that's so great, now emma has two hugsy's."
9,17,joey:," no, no, emma has one hugsy, the new hugsy, huh? the other hugsy, i don't know, i guess i'll just take it back."
9,17,rachel:," oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid her tail... "
9,17,joey:, make the transfer! 
9,17,rachel:, should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can't find it?
9,17,joey:," oh, no don't worry about that, i swallowed that years ago. "
9,17,rachel:," oh, i don't think she likes the new hugsy."
9,17,joey:, but he's the same.
9,17,rachel:," yeah, i think she wants the old one back."
9,17,joey:, but he's the same.
9,17,rachel:," joey, come on!"
9,17,joey:, he's the same! .
9,17,joey:, you're not the same! 
9,17,monica:, haha!
9,17,phoebe:," you know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after i've buzzed you into the building."
9,17,monica:," so phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
9,17,phoebe:, those are my shoes.
9,17,monica:," oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping."
9,17,phoebe:," monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but i'm actually feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kinda want to be alone right now. "
9,17,monica:, who's that? 
9,17,phoebe:, i ordered chinese food. 
9,17,phoebe:, what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike!?
9,17,monica:, what are you doing here?
9,17,mike:, phoebe called me.
9,17,monica:, phoebe!
9,17,phoebe:," i'm sorry, i broke down... i wanted to see him."
9,17,monica:, damnit phoebe! how did you even call him?
9,17,phoebe:, there is a speakerphone on the base unit... 
9,17,monica:, base unit! think monica! think!
9,17,mike:," look, if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see... "
9,17,monica:, this doesn't concern you!!
9,17,mike:," oh! sorry, i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name!"
9,17,monica:," look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."
9,17,phoebe:, not if nothing happens. why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
9,17,monica:," sure! if you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe i'll join ya. you know, i'm your friend and mike's friend ."
9,17,phoebe:, sit down. 
9,17,monica:, oh wow wow wow!! make room for your friend! 
9,17,mike:, so how've you been?
9,17,monica:, i've been pretty good!
9,17,mike:, you look really beautiful.
9,17,phoebe:," thanks, you look good too."
9,17,monica:, oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. keep it clean!
9,17,phoebe:, so how's the piano playing going?
9,17,mike:, actually i've been playing a lot of love songs lately. i've missed you.
9,17,phoebe:, i've missed you too. 
9,17,monica:," you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up. and then a pigeon ate it! "
9,17,chandler:," hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
9,17,ross:," uhu uhu, check this out. "
9,17,chandler:, huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out are ya?
9,17,ross:," eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little ""ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead. oh my god! nobody cares that i'm dead!?"
9,17,chandler:," no, come on, you know that's not true."
9,17,ross:, what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead!
9,17,chandler:," well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
9,17,ross:, i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy! 
9,17,chandler:," alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
9,17,ross:, you're right. there isn't a decent outlet.
9,17,chandler:," right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
9,17,ross:, exactly!! 
9,17,chandler:," ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? you're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
9,17,ross:, no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me!
9,17,chandler:," ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
9,17,ross:," oh, too late, too late! it's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... "
9,17,rachel:," i'm trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy?"
9,17,joey:, original or crappy?
9,17,rachel:, original.
9,17,joey:," no, sorry haven't seen him."
9,17,rachel:, then what's that big lump under your covers?
9,17,joey:," it's monica, ok?"
9,17,rachel:, that's not monica!
9,17,joey:," alright!! fine! it's original hugsy! no, now i know that emma wants him but he's mine and i need him.."
9,17,rachel:, oh god.
9,17,joey:, ... she's being unreasonable!
9,17,rachel:," joey, there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much oh don't cover its ears! it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey!"
9,17,joey:, it does?
9,17,rachel:, yeah! and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much.
9,17,joey:, really? she... she loves me?
9,17,rachel:," oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, don't worry. emma will totally understand. i won't... but whatever ."
9,17,joey:," ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i mean if if... . if hugsy means that much to emma then... well she can have him."
9,17,rachel:," oooh... you're sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up. look emma, look who's baaack!"
9,17,joey:, look forget it forget it... i can't do it.
9,17,rachel:, are you gonna... you're going to take hugsy away from a little child?
9,17,joey:, how do you think i got him in the first place? 
9,17,monica:," mucus, fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it."
9,17,mike:," i've missed you so much! no, i'm not gonna ask you to get back together because i know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night."
9,17,phoebe:," i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard?"
9,17,mike:," it can't be any harder than this... i mean, if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time, i... i would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time... i never would have stopped."
9,17,monica:," kiss him, you fool!!"
9,17,phoebe:, what?
9,17,monica:, didn't you hear that speech? if you don't kiss him then i will!
9,17,phoebe:, i knew you'd be here!
9,17,mike:," oh, crap!"
9,17,phoebe:, who is this?
9,17,mike:, my friend manny. i asked him to keep me away from you.
9,17,monica:," hi, that's what i'm doing for phoebe!"
9,17,manny:," well, you are not doing a very good job!"
9,17,monica:, excuse me?
9,17,manny:, what's with the kissing?
9,17,monica:," hey, at least i knew where my guy was."
9,17,manny:," oh yeah yeah, thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing!"
9,17,monica:, you didn't hear the speech!
9,17,manny:," ""if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... """
9,17,monica:," hey, it was very moving! you're just heartless!"
9,17,manny:, you're weak!
9,17,monica:, you're... weird!
9,17,manny:, your pants are undone!
9,17,monica:, oh !
9,17,manny:, where did they go?
9,17,monica:, damn it!
9,17,manny:, oh we blew it. i blame myself.
9,17,monica:, and i blame you too. 
9,17,ross:," it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted! "
9,17,chandler:, there you go! someone came!
9,17,ross:," ok, ok! i'm gonna go hide! oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! "
9,17,monica:," hi, glad you could come."
9,17,chandler:," please, come in."
9,17,tom:," hi, you're chandler bing, right? i'm tom gordon, i was in your class."
9,17,chandler:," oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
9,17,tom:," thanks... uh... i'm so sorry about ross, it's... "
9,17,chandler:, at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps 
9,17,ross:, who is he?
9,17,chandler:," some guy, tom gordon."
9,17,ross:," i don't remember him, but then again i touched so many lives. "
9,17,monica:," so, did you know ross well?"
9,17,tom:," oh, actually i barely knew him. yeah, i came because i heard chandler's news. d'you know if he's seeing anyone?"
9,17,monica:," yes, he is. me."
9,17,tom:, what? you... you... oh! can i ask you a personal question? ho how do you shave your beard so close?
9,17,chandler:," ok tommy, that's enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!! "
9,17,tom:," hey, listen. call me."
9,17,chandler:, ok! 
9,17,ross:, i'm dead and no one cares?
9,17,monica:, i look like a man??
9,17,chandler:," please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
9,17,ross:," it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here!"
9,17,chandler:," you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
9,17,ross:," yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone?"
9,17,chandler:," oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something?"
9,17,ross:," yeah... oh, great. more party boys for chandler!"
9,17,chandler:," i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide. "
9,17,kori:, hi. i'm here for ross geller's memorial service.
9,17,chandler:, kori? kori weston?
9,17,kori:, yeah...

9,17,chandler:," don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! "
9,17,kori:, i can't believe that ross is gone. it is just so sad.
9,17,chandler:, i didn't know ross and you were so close.
9,17,kori:, we weren't but we had one class together. he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. i always remembered him.
9,17,chandler:," i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
9,17,kori:, i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. i guess i really missed my chance.
9,17,ross:," but you didn't! i'm still alive!! kori, i know this is a big surprise for you. it's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! i mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
9,17,kori:," you sick freak, who does that? i can't believe i had a crush on you! "
9,17,ross:, did you hear that? kori weston had a crush on me!! ending credits 
9,17,ross:," no mum, i'm not dead. i know it's not something to kid about. it was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it's over, ok? actually no, even if i had died, you would not be left childless. monica?"

9,18,monica:," hey, maybe i'll drive you up there! i'd like to buy some tickets myself! "
9,18,joey:, uh!
9,18,monica:," yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars."
9,18,chandler:," yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300 million? no thank you!"
9,18,phoebe:, hey will you get me tickets too?
9,18,rachel:, yeah thats a great idea!

9,18,ross:, no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? i...i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
9,18,chandler:, yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
9,18,joey:, i like those odds!
9,18,ross:," seriously you guys, i can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, i mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
9,18,chandler:, i'll ask. boohaki?

9,18,rachel:," yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker."
9,18,monica:, how do you know she's gonna start talking?

9,18,joey:, oh yeah! the casserole lady.
9,18,monica:," so, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?"
9,18,ross:," yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it! "
9,18,chandler:," don't touch the phone! i'll get it, i'll get it, i'll get it!! "
9,18,ross:, think he washed his hands?

9,18,phoebe:," hey you guys! ok, you're not going to believe this! i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!"
9,18,monica:," hey that reminds me, i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work."
9,18,ross:, a psychic and a wishbone? guys! give someone else a chance!
9,18,monica:," alright, who wants to do it?"
9,18,phoebe:," oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it's really not fair either! you know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
9,18,monica:," ok, hey rach?"
9,18,rachel:," oh no, i'm good, i don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands."
9,18,joey:, i'll do it!! it'll get the casserole stink off of mine. 
9,18,phoebe:, i hope i win!
9,18,monica:," well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?"
9,18,joey:, i can't tell you what i'm wishing for! else...you know...won't come true!
9,18,monica:," right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!"
9,18,joey:, can't really say!
9,18,monica:," i understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?"
9,18,joey:," please, just do it!"
9,18,phoebe:," one, two, three! "
9,18,joey:," i won, hey!"
9,18,ross:," you know what, i'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! ah!! that thing gets hot!!"
9,18,rachel:," you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you gonna feel if we actually do win?"
9,18,ross:," uh, you're not gonna win."
9,18,rachel:," oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! and then how you gonna feel? you know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, i can't guys, i'll meet you guys up there, i gotta gas up the hyundai"""
9,18,ross:," ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that."
9,18,chandler:," ""lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm""."
9,18,ross:, why would i eat my own arm?
9,18,chandler:," well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
9,18,monica:," you know what, ross? i'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you."
9,18,ross:, why?
9,18,monica:," because i know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. and you're my brother, and i want you to be a part of this."
9,18,ross:," you don't have to do that, i'll pay for myself. but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys that's so sweet! come here "
9,18,phoebe:, get a room!
9,18,chandler:," ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
9,18,ross:," i don't know, probably just invest it."
9,18,chandler:, ooh! calm down ...
9,18,joey:," seriously, that's your fantasy? to invest it? "
9,18,ross:," oh, i'm sorry, did i say ""invest it""? i meant ""be cool and piss it all away"" "
9,18,joey:," ooh, ooh, i know! we should pool all own money and buy the knicks!"
9,18,rachel:, i don't really care about the knicks.
9,18,joey:," oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward."
9,18,rachel:, you would do that? i never get picked!
9,18,chandler:," you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
9,18,joey:, you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're taking this away from me!
9,18,chandler:," you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
9,18,ross:," uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy? "
9,18,chandler:, i'll take this one too uh ... mommy?
9,18,ross:," oh, i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel ""mommy"" when we're around emma. which i now realize we are not ..."
9,18,rachel:, i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
9,18,ross:," although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""daddy"" too."
9,18,phoebe:," oooh, i like that, ""daddy"" "
9,18,ross:, i ... i was just talking about rachel.
9,18,phoebe:," oooh, is daddy getting angry? is daddy gonna spank me?"
9,18,ross:, well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no i can't. 
9,18,chandler:," hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright, bye. "
9,18,joey:," dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right?"
9,18,chandler:," well no, charlie's gonna get that."
9,18,monica:," hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!"
9,18,chandler:, he's the boss's son.
9,18,monica:," come on, lottery!! "
9,18,rachel:," ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes."
9,18,monica:," we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first."
9,18,rachel:," ooh, i have another idea!"
9,18,monica:," i'm sorry, idea time is over."
9,18,phoebe:," ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?"
9,18,monica:, yeah.
9,18,chandler:, what about the ones you have on the nightstand?
9,18,monica:, there are no tickets on the nightstand!
9,18,chandler:," yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago. "
9,18,monica:," un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken!"
9,18,chandler:," honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
9,18,monica:," chandler, sense the tone!! "
9,18,rachel:," well, well, well, look what mommy found!! "
9,18,monica:," ok, fine!! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler."
9,18,phoebe:, uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed.
9,18,ross:," i can't believe this, i thought we were all in this together!"
9,18,monica:," hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!"
9,18,ross:, 3 minutes ago!!! i don't know why that's important ...
9,18,joey:," i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut, when did you even get those?"
9,18,monica:, when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
9,18,joey:, i'll show you how.
9,18,rachel:," ok, well monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?"
9,18,monica:," please ... if i win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. someone gave me a basket of mini muffins last week and i couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!"
9,18,rachel:," chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?"
9,18,chandler:," she's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ..."
9,18,monica:, ahhh! 
9,18,chandler:," let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! "
9,18,monica:, there's the man i married!!
9,18,rachel:," all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!"
9,18,monica:," fine! don't be my friends! i'll buy new friends! yeah, and then i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!"
9,18,rachel:," oh! alright, you know what? that's it! i want my share of the tickets !"
9,18,joey:," yeah, i want my tickets too ! and i'm buying the knicks! and steffi graff, ah ah!"
9,18,ross:," than i want mine, too ! and if i win i'm gonna put it all into a very low yield bond."
9,18,phoebe:," oh, you guys! we've got to keep all the tickets together "
9,18,monica:," no, no! we should divide them up and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them!"
9,18,joey:," hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all thing was my idea! "
9,18,chandler:," oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!"
9,18,rachel:," ok, that's it! just give'em to me! i'll split them up! "
9,18,joey:, oh!
9,18,phoebe:, ooooohhhhh!
9,18,ross:," hey, hey!!"
9,18,phoebe:," ooooohhhhh! fine, i can't take it anymore! i'm putting an end to this! "
9,18,rachel:," oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets."
9,18,joey:," no, no! "
9,18,phoebe:," if we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! so, say goodbye to your tickets! ."
9,18,everyone:, no!!
9,18,phoebe:, don't come any closer!
9,18,chandler:," can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished..."
9,18,phoebe:, friends!

9,18,phoebe:," hey monica, what about your extra tickets?"
9,18,monica:, they're all in there! even these five that i hid in my bra ...
9,18,ross:, monica!
9,18,phoebe:," ok, good! you guys were so scared! there was no way i was gonna dump this... oh god, no! i think i broke your bowl."
9,18,ross:," go, go, go!! "
9,18,phoebe:," what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun."
9,18,monica:," phoebe, we lost half of them."
9,18,phoebe:," so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said i was gonna win, remember?"
9,18,ross:, weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
9,18,phoebe:," as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die. so, excuse me for being a little skittish."
9,18,chandler:," hey, there's two messages. these could be from work!"
9,18,monica:," oh, play them!"
9,18,chandler:," ok, here we go! "
9,18,message:," ""hello. th this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise"" ""i sh.. i shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. it it was all my fault. not hers. bye. coo."" "

9,18,rachel:," oh, it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted sandra over me at work."
9,18,chandler:," oh, is she related to ralph lauren?"
9,18,rachel:," no, she was just much better at job than me!"
9,18,phoebe:," guys, the drawing is about to start!"
9,18,rachel:, you know what? we should call my mum's house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down.
9,18,ross:," oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
9,18,monica:," honey, you've been really strong about this, i know how badly you wanted that job."
9,18,chandler:," yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it. but... let's go win the lottery... i mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?"
9,18,monica:, 131!

9,18,ross:," oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
9,18,rachel:, why why aren't you more excited?
9,18,ross:," oh, rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word."
9,18,rachel:," oh, but of course it is!"
9,18,ross:," okay, what does it mean?"
9,18,rachel:, i don't know all the words.
9,18,ross:," i'm just, i'm just glad i didn't miss my daughter's first words ."

9,18,steve:," chandler, hi! i'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. we just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant."
9,18,chandler:," oh no no no no, i'd love to be somebody's assistant! answering phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and i'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
9,18,steve:," chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. we're offering you the position of junior copywriter."

9,18,chandler:," wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout."
9,18,phoebe:," i don't care, i've never won anything before, i can't believe this!"
9,18,rachel:," so pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?"

9,19,chandler:, that's insane!
9,19,ross:," totally insane. dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."

9,19,ross:," oh, that's not cool."
9,19,chandlers:," dude, none of this is cool."
9,19,ross:," hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. now, the salt shaker is off limits, but the salt i wish i'd thought this through."
9,19,chandler:," i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that."
9,19,ross:," not my first time in a hotel, my friend."

9,19,chandler:, no!
9,19,ross:, at least tell me where you hid it. 
9,19,rachel:, can i ask you a question?
9,19,monica:, yeah.
9,19,rachel:, have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
9,19,monica:," let me think. oh, when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese, and on our wedding night i ate his head."
9,19,rachel:," ok, well this is like that...in no way. i had a...i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey."
9,19,monica:," wow, do you mean like kiss him kiss him?"
9,19,rachel:," oh yeah! i mean, that was pretty intense."
9,19,monica:, what do you think brought than on?
9,19,rachel:," i don't know! i mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday."
9,19,monica:, a love scene? with who?
9,19,rachel:, olivia.
9,19,monica:," olivia? i thought she was marrying connor! oh right, real life more important."
9,19,rachel:, so do you think that my dream means anything?
9,19,monica:," i don't know. i mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for joey, maybe you have a thing for drake."
9,19,rachel:, ah! well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream...
9,19,monica:," of course it was! trust me, when it comes to psychology i know what i'm talking about. i took two psych classes in college. "
9,19,rachel:, you took the same class twice.
9,19,monica:, hi.
9,19,phoebe:," here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! right? i mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
9,19,monica:," oh...phoebe? maybe i wasn't clear before. i really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
9,19,phoebe:," right, yeah, ok, i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
9,19,monica:," phoebe, it's not what you wear. it's sort of your songs... i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."
9,19,phoebe:," hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work..."
9,19,phoebe:, my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
9,19,rachel:," ok, we're still on that."
9,19,monica:, i didn't say your songs were not good enough.
9,19,phoebe:, then what's wrong with them? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
9,19,monica:, tiny portions?
9,19,phoebe:," yeah well, ""excuse me, i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but i can't see it, i can't see it""!"
9,19,monica:," phoebe, it's not about quantity."
9,19,phoebe:, well...it's not about quality.
9,19,monica:," oh really, you want to talk about quality? have you heard of a key? it's what some people sing in."
9,19,phoebe:," well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. yeah, there are other ingredients monica."
9,19,monica:," ok, so that's what we're doing. you know, when i'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, i'm wearing ear plugs."
9,19,phoebe:," ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
9,19,monica:," you know what? i take back what i said before. you keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
9,19,phoebe:," what are people having, the garlic martini? "
9,19,receptionist:," here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay."
9,19,chandler:," oh, i didn't factor in the room tax."
9,19,ross:, oh my god.
9,19,chandler:, what?
9,19,ross:, there's something new in the bowl.
9,19,chandler:," look, we have enough, just walk away."
9,19,ross:," no, but i want...i want the pinecones!"
9,19,chandler:, there's a forest right outside.
9,19,ross:, it's not the same.
9,19,chandler:," oh, my maple candy! "
9,19,phoebe:," thank god, it's just you! i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall."
9,19,phoebe:," you'd better get back in that kitchen monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
9,19,monica:," ok, you have to stop playing now."
9,19,phoebe:, why? the only person my playing is bothering is you!
9,19,monica:," oh yeah? ok, let's settle this, come on!"
9,19,phoebe:, get your garlic peelers off me!
9,19,monica:," by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? "
9,19,phoebe:," ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? ha!"
9,19,monica:," how many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? ."
9,19,phoebe:," ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
9,19,monica:, ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? 
9,19,phoebe:," ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? ."
9,19,monica:, who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? 
9,19,phoebe:, oh...who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! 
9,19,monica:, i'm sorry...
9,19,phoebe:, i'm sorry too... 
9,19,monica:, ooohh... hey! wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner? 
9,19,phoebe:, who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? 
9,19,rachel:, hey!
9,19,joey:, hey!
9,19,rachel:," joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
9,19,joey:, oh man! i thought i got it all!
9,19,rachel:, how...how...?
9,19,joey:," i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? "
9,19,rachel:, uh huh
9,19,joey:," and i couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important can that be, right...? turns out very! "
9,19,rachel:, wow...definitely just drake...
9,19,joey:, what?
9,19,rachel:, what...how is it going with drake?
9,19,joey:, oh...i don't think it's going very well...
9,19,rachel:, what...that scene i saw was so good!
9,19,joey:," well, i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
9,19,rachel:," joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so i'll give you a compliment?"
9,19,joey:," a little. yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia."
9,19,rachel:, so?
9,19,joey:, so...i've never played that!
9,19,rachel:," ooh! honey, it can't be that hard, i mean, you've been in love before?"
9,19,joey:, uh...well...just once...with you...
9,19,rachel:, ok...this could be a little awkward...i'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
9,19,joey:, what the hell are you talking about??
9,19,rachel:," alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
9,19,joey:," oh! ok, yeah, i think i can do that. yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
9,19,rachel:," joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
9,19,joey:, thanks dude!!!this is great!! closing credits 
9,19,chandler:, i got you something from vermont!

9,20,phoebe:," monica, you might want to remember that you are married. where is chandler anyway? "
9,20,monica:, oh my god! chandler!

9,20,rachel:, yeah!
9,20,monica:, i guess you have forgotten all about joey?
9,20,rachel:," yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten about joey and clearly you've forgotten about chandler!"
9,20,monica:," so, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston, huh?"
9,20,charlie:," actually, i'm kinda happy to be leaving... i just broke up with someeone."
9,20,ross:," ooh... so sad... still, it can't be easy for you to leave harvard? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?"
9,20,charlie:," actually, alby is the guy i broke up with."
9,20,ross:, you... you dated albert wintermeyer?
9,20,charlie:, yeah...
9,20,ross:, ... and you called him alby!? i mean that's like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby...
9,20,charlie:," yeah, well, he is a brilliant man."
9,20,ross:," eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
9,20,charlie:," yes! and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues..."
9,20,ross:," oh! like what?! oh i'm sorry, i don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""access hollywood""."
9,20,charlie:," ok, you want the dirt? alby was seriously insecure. i mean, he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him."
9,20,ross:, who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?
9,20,charlie:, a guy who won two.
9,20,ross:, two? wha...? don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart
9,20,charlie:, yeah... for three years.
9,20,ross:, oh my god! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the nobel prize?
9,20,charlie:, ... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend billy.
9,20,ross:," oh yeah? no, no nobel prizes for him?"
9,20,charlie:," no, but he did just win the mcarthur genius grant."
9,20,ross:, huh... huh... what a loser! some more wine? 
9,20,phoebe:, hey ross!
9,20,rache:, how is it going with charlie?
9,20,ross:, oh great! after i finish my wine i'm going to blow my... eh. average sized brains out.
9,20,phoebe:," oh, what's the matter?"
9,20,ross:," she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners. oh my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
9,20,rachel:, i always loved that!!
9,20,ross:," of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! man, i can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my god!"
9,20,phoebe:, worse?
9,20,ross:," oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... ""can we walk""? oh, you... you like that?"
9,20,phoebe:, no. 
9,20,ross:, what? 
9,20,rachel:," well, i bet you are all thinkin' ""now would be a really great time for an intermission"", huh?"
9,20,chandler:, divorce is a 4 letter word. how could he leave me?!?!
9,20,chandler:, i... i don't know... you seem lovely. 
9,20,joey:," hey ross, this is one of my co stars, dirk. dirk, this is my good friend ross. "

9,20,dirk:," hey ross, listen, dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or..."
9,20,ross:," oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
9,20,dirk:," hey, i got a 690 on my sats."
9,20,ross:," that's it, just sign right on the bra ."
9,20,joey:, monica!
9,20,monica:, what have you got there?
9,20,ross:, just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
9,20,joey:," ah, let me see! damn, that's a lot of guys! are you a little slutty?"
9,20,rachel:, i think i am.
9,20,joey:," pass, pass, oh, pass, double pass, pass..."
9,20,rachel:," why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
9,20,joey:," nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
9,20,rachel:," joey, you're so sweet."
9,20,joey:," that's true. but you know what, it doesn't matter because i already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
9,20,rachel:, me.
9,20,rachel:, what? really?
9,20,joey:," yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
9,20,rachel:," oh! screw it, i didn't get it! "
9,20,joey:, gotcha.
9,20,rachel:," so, how did you enjoy the play?"
9,20,monica:," oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry."
9,20,chandler:, well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
9,20,monica:, you really liked it?
9,20,chandler:," ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", i was uplifted."
9,20,monica:, oh really!
9,20,chandler:," oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!"
9,20,monica:, no!
9,20,chandler:, did somebody sign your bra?
9,20,monica:, so i got it when i was 13... 
9,20,phoebe:," hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
9,20,ross:," it's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
9,20,phoebe:," go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average joe phd."
9,20,ross:," yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean, i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited."
9,20,phoebe:," you're so much more than just brains! you're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
9,20,ross:, and sexy.
9,20,phoebe:, ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
9,20,ross:," yeah, you're right, thanks pheebs, i'm gonna go find her."
9,20,phoebe:," good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch!"
9,20,ross:, hey!
9,20,monica:, hey!
9,20,rachel:," i'm gonna do it, i'm gonna kiss joey."
9,20,monica:," no, you can't! friends hooking up is a bad idea."
9,20,rachel:," please, what about you and chandler?"
9,20,monica:, that's different! i was drunk and stupid!
9,20,rachel:, well hello !
9,20,monica:, what about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? why don't you just kiss one of them?
9,20,rachel:," i could, i could but i don't want to! i want to kiss joey!"
9,20,monica:, alright . i think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
9,20,rachel:, i'm gonna do it.
9,20,monica:, and i can't stop you.
9,20,rachel:, i'm smarter than him! closing credits 
9,20,phoebe:," hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler."
9,20,chandler:," oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you."

9,21,teleplay:," eleonora, pheeboh, sebastiano & vanessa "
9,21,monica:," it's so weird, how did joey end up kissing charlie last night? i thought you'd end up kissing charlie."
9,21,ross:," hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise!"
9,21,chandler:," i missed most of the party charlie's a girl, right?"
9,21,ross:," yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss."
9,21,rachel:," i don't know why joey had to kiss her! i mean, of all the girls at the party, god!"
9,21,ross:, why do you care so much?
9,21,monica:," yes rachel, why do you care so much?"
9,21,rachel:, be cause ross is the father of my child! you know... and i... want him to hook up with lots of women! i just... all i'm saying is... i don't think that joey and charlie have anything in common.
9,21,ross:," oh, i don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils..."
9,21,phoebe:," wow, joey and a professor! can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism... oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
9,21,rachel:," all right, so... ross, you're ok with all this? i mean..."
9,21,ross:," oh, god. i forgot how hot she was!"
9,21,joey:, hey!
9,21,all:, hi!

9,21,charlie:," oh, you know what? i'll come with you!"
9,21,ross:, ok. 
9,21,chandler:," so, a professor, uh?"
9,21,joey:," yeah! she is cool, and she's so smart! her mind is totally acrimonious . that's not how she used it...?"
9,21,charlie:," i feel like i owe you an explanation. i don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. i'm... well, i'm kind of embarrassed. i really hope you don't think less of me."
9,21,ross:," uhm no! think less of you! no, i don't think less of you. i mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. i mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those those people are stupid, i hate those people."
9,21,charlie:," you know, actually i'm a little surprised to myself. i mean, joey is so different from the guys i usually date. i mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral..."
9,21,ross:," yeah, i know the type."
9,21,joey:," hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. no? am i getting close? opening credits "
9,21,phoebe:, hey!
9,21,monica:, hey!
9,21,phoebe:, hey you guys! look what i just got.

9,21,rachel:," phoebe, shania twain is still alive!"
9,21,phoebe:, oh... then i overpaid. 
9,21,monica:," hey, what's this?"
9,21,rachel:," oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in soho."
9,21,monica:," oh, you can't show phoebe this! she hates those corporate massage chains."
9,21,rachel:," ah, why, now i can't get a massage? there are so many things that she disapproves of! i can't eat veal, i can't wear fur, i can't go hunting..."
9,21,monica:, do you wanna go hunting?
9,21,rachel:," well, i would like to have the option!!"
9,21,phoebe:," what's up? hey, rachel!!"
9,21,rachel:, oh!
9,21,phoebe:," no, you can't go there! you know how i feel about these ""big massage places""! they're putting people like me out of business!"
9,21,monica:," and she wants to go hunting, too!!"
9,21,rachel:," phoebe, come on, i don't wanna waste it! it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!"
9,21,phoebe:," ok, this is not about the money, ok? it's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells."
9,21,rachel:, i don't care about any of that!!
9,21,phoebe:," well, do you care about friendship?"
9,21,rachel:, oh!
9,21,phoebe:," i feel really strongly about this, rachel. please, don't use this gift certificate. i'm asking you as a friend."
9,21,rachel:," oh, not as a friend, phoebe!! fine, i won't use it!"
9,21,phoebe:, promise?

9,21,monica:," ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience! besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
9,21,chandler:, we really need to take those tests?
9,21,monica:," honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. just a few routine tests."
9,21,chandler:, but i don't wanna do it in a cup!
9,21,monica:, what is the big deal?
9,21,chandler:, it's weird! in a doctor's office?
9,21,monica:, it's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell?
9,21,chandler:," i cannot believe ross told you that! and in my defense, it was a wendy's!"
9,21,monica:," look, i don't wanna do this test either, but i really do think it's a good idea!"
9,21,chandler:," yeah, ok. i'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory!"
9,21,monica:, oh!
9,21,chandler:," oh, yeah! rachel talks too! "
9,21,joey:, who says that wine has to cost more than milk!

9,21,monica:," hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
9,21,chandler:, why are you here?
9,21,janice:," well, sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we..."
9,21,chandler:," no no no... i mean, why? why is she here??"
9,21,janice:, oh! someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! oh! they gave you the kiddy size .
9,21,chandler:, what!? 
9,21,monica:, this was fun! but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! 
9,21,chandler:," i'd love to stay, but i have eh... got a hot date... "
9,21,janice:, please... go! just let me know if you need a hand!
9,21,chandler:, i think it just fell off. 
9,21,phoebe:," hello ""ja"", it's time for your massage, ja! put your face in the hole."
9,21,rachel:," wow, a swedish massage from a real swedish person. "
9,21,phoebe:," okay, then i'm swedish..."
9,21,monica:," so, what's your name?"
9,21,phoebe:, it's a normal swedish name... ikea...
9,21,rachel:, oh... what an interesting name.
9,21,phoebe:, ja!
9,21,rachel:, you know i... 
9,21,phoebe:, time for your scalp massage!
9,21,rachel:, wow... i really love your... 
9,21,phoebe:, is something wrong?
9,21,rachel:," no, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... ikea... yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of sweden?"
9,21,phoebe:, uhm... stockholm.
9,21,rachel:, damn! i wish i knew if that was right! 
9,21,joey:, note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
9,21,ross:," now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
9,21,joey:," no, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
9,21,ross:," ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt m o n a y. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you."
9,21,joey:, phonetically? 
9,21,ross:," yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time for this."
9,21,joey:, ok.
9,21,ross:," ok, but you know what? i gotta say, i'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
9,21,joey:," ah! i'm an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on ""days"" i had to say ""frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
9,21,ross:, wow. what does that mean?
9,21,joey:," no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
9,21,ross:, ok! so let's move on to the renaissance?
9,21,joey:," ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. touch it, it's really bumpy! ."
9,21,ross:," nah ah! nah ah! no no no! no ad libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
9,21,joey:, come on! you... 
9,21,ross:, no! 
9,21,chandler:, my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there. really helped speed the process along! janice! you're not... gone?
9,21,janice:, oh! sid is still in his room. i don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. so did you do it? did you make your deposit?
9,21,chandler:, yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!
9,21,janice:," that's not the hard part honey! the hard part is what comes next, i mean aren't you worried about the results?"
9,21,chandler:, i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
9,21,janice:," oh! well, you know what? it probably is."
9,21,chandler:," yeah, but what if it's not? what if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
9,21,janice:," oh, chandler, look. you and monica are meant to have children. i am sure it's gonna be just fine."
9,21,chandler:," oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'..."
9,21,janice:," what, you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?"
9,21,chandler:," it was a ""wendy's!! "" "
9,21,phoebe:," ""ipan stripan, glupi glabi! "" and that is the swedish national anthem! thank you for asking! "
9,21,rachel:," wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have a friend who is a masseuse."
9,21,phoebe:," oh, ja! ja!"
9,21,rachel:, yah! she's... uhm... not very good though... 
9,21,phoebe:," uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?"
9,21,rachel:, i don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
9,21,phoebe:, or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
9,21,rachel:, phoebe!!
9,21,phoebe:, you know it's me?
9,21,rachel:," for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden!"
9,21,phoebe:, how can you come here?
9,21,rachel:, how could you not tell me you worked here?
9,21,phoebe:, i don't have to tell you everything!
9,21,rachel:," yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!"
9,21,phoebe:, tips not included.
9,21,rachel:," oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
9,21,phoebe:," because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know... you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! paying taxes!"
9,21,rachel:," phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles and i so admire that! i don't have any!"
9,21,phoebe:, you know what? you are right. i am gonna quit. it's time i took my life back!
9,21,rachel:, good for you pheebs!
9,21,phoebe:, ok.
9,21,phoebe:," okay if you guys have microphones in there too, i didn't mean any of that. i love you. "
9,21,ross:," haha! got ya! die, die, die! "
9,21,ross:," respectfully, professor r. geller. hey!"
9,21,charlie:, hi!
9,21,ross:," hey, how was the met?"
9,21,charlie:, the museum was amazing!
9,21,ross:," yeah? joey really knows his art, huh?"
9,21,charlie:," not so much, no. he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense."
9,21,ross:, what do you mean?
9,21,charlie:," well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around."
9,21,ross:," wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right?"
9,21,charlie:," no, we went to the left."
9,21,ross:," oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together."
9,21,charlie:," yeah, it's fun ."
9,21,ross:, what?
9,21,charlie:," actually, you know, joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird."
9,21,ross:," what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
9,21,charlie:," well... i'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe i should be with someone... i have more in common with. you know what i mean?"
9,21,ross:," yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
9,21,charlie:," yeah, i guess that's true."
9,21,ross:," and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that's the kind of guy joey is."
9,21,charlie:, he is very sweet. plus he's hot!
9,21,ross:, that was going to be my next argument. 
9,21,joey:, hey!
9,21,ross:, hey!
9,21,charlie:, hey!
9,21,joey:, you're ready?
9,21,charlie:," yeah, let's go. thanks ross."
9,21,joey:," hey ross! that art stuff worked, you hooked me up."
9,21,ross:, glad i could help man.
9,21,joey:," although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... i made it work. "
9,21,chandler:, it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now. 
9,21,chandler:," hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. no, she's not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? oh. well, so what does that mean? ok. ok, thank you. thanks. "
9,21,monica:, hey sweetie.
9,21,chandler:, doctor connelly just called.
9,21,monica:," with good news? of course it is not good news, you just said ""doctor connelly just called"". if it was good news you would have said ""doctor connelly just called! "" but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem with me or with you?"
9,21,chandler:, actually it's both of us.
9,21,monica:, what?
9,21,chandler:, apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
9,21,monica:, oh... what does that mean?
9,21,chandler:, it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. it means...
9,21,monica:, chandler?
9,21,chandler:," it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us."
9,21,monica:, oh my god!
9,21,chandler:, i'm sorry.
9,21,monica:, i'm sorry too. 
9,21,chandler:," well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
9,21,monica:, i know. closing credits 
9,21,receptionist:, good morning phoebe.
9,21,phoebe:, good morning receptionist.
9,21,receptionist:, here's your schedule for the day. your first client is in room no. 1.
9,21,phoebe:," rachel green? son of a bitch, she came back? "
9,21,phoebe:," are you ready for your scottish massage? put your face in the hole, lassy."
9,22,charlie:, oh! that feels sooo good!
9,22,rachel:," oh, lucky me! coffee and a live sex show!"
9,22,charlie:," i'm sorry, what?"
9,22,rachel:," oh... oh, i'm sorry! i'm not... i was just i was just reading to emma."
9,22,charlie:, from... cosmo??
9,22,rachel:," yeah, yeah... it's... ""climax your way to better skin""."
9,22,charlie:," so, i have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, i'm soo bad at picking out clothes!"
9,22,joey:," so you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
9,22,rachel:," not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
9,22,joey:, oh hey rach!
9,22,rachel:, yeah...
9,22,joey:, maybe you could take charlie shopping.
9,22,rachel:," oh, well..."
9,22,charlie:, i'm sure you have better things to do.
9,22,joey:," are you kidding? rachel loves to shop! and she has great taste! yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
9,22,charlie:," if you have the time, i'd really appreciate the help."
9,22,rachel:," ok, uh uh... let's let's shop!!"
9,22,joey:," ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, slutty!"
9,22,phoebe:," ok, great! all right, bye! pain in the ass!! that's off, right?"
9,22,joey:," what's the matter, pheebs?"
9,22,phoebe:," oh... mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. and she was like ""oh, don't worry! i asked him. he's totally ok with seeing you!"". so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him!"
9,22,rachel:," which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
9,22,phoebe:, exactly!
9,22,rachel:, and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
9,22,phoebe:," i didn't even think about that! aaargh, sexual politics!!"
9,22,rachel:," hey pheebs, i'm i'm taking charlie shopping, why don't you come and i'll help you find something."
9,22,phoebe:," ok, that'll be great!"
9,22,joey:," oh, ain't that nice? the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
9,22,rachel:, that's not what we're gonna do!
9,22,joey:," why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'? opening credits "
9,22,chandler:, wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!
9,22,monica:," oh, i so can't believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
9,22,chandler:, hi there.
9,22,chandler:, hi.
9,22,monica:, i'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options.
9,22,monica:," above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! so, keep having sex on a regular basis."
9,22,chandler:," oh, damn it! "
9,22,monica:," ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor."
9,22,monica:," and, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt."
9,22,chandler:," is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! wow, talking about an inhospitable environment! "
9,22,rachel:," hi! ok, you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?"
9,22,charlie:," oh, yeah! let's do it!"
9,22,joey:," alright, have a good time. "
9,22,rachel:, not gonna find any clothes in there!
9,22,ross:," hey, you guys!"
9,22,rachel:, hi.
9,22,ross:, guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference?
9,22,charlie:, umh... kurts baley?
9,22,ross:," yeah, right! what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract well, why are you laughing?"
9,22,joey:," just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
9,22,charlie:, so you're up for keynote speaker! who's making the decisions?
9,22,ross:," professor sherman, yeah. i've a meeting with him today."
9,22,charlie:, he's a pretty tough guy to impress.
9,22,ross:," yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him."
9,22,rachel:," oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
9,22,ross:, tsz... no! .
9,22,chandler:, hey guys!
9,22,ross:," wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
9,22,chandler:," i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
9,22,ross:, it's in barbados.
9,22,chandler:, but you come first!
9,22,rachel:, i'm there!
9,22,charlie:," we'll see you, guys! "
9,22,joey:, bye.
9,22,rachel:," bye, see ya. "
9,22,chandler:, ok.
9,22,joey:," all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic?"
9,22,chandler:, not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
9,22,ross:, so so what did the doctor say?
9,22,chandler:," well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
9,22,joey:, so you're ruling out surrogacy?
9,22,chandler:, yeah.
9,22,joey:," so, i don't have to learn what that means?"
9,22,chandler:," aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
9,22,joey:," enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs?"
9,22,chandler:, ah ha!
9,22,ross:, how do you feel about all this?
9,22,chandler:, i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one.
9,22,joey:," come on ross, be a good guy. step up and do it!"
9,22,ross:, what? 
9,22,ross:, what? no! i am not going to give them ben! 
9,22,ross:, mmm mm.
9,22,ross:," i mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. so so what i am saying is is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles! "
9,22,ross:, incentive for men?
9,22,phoebe:," oh, i'll take some of that."
9,22,rachel:," pheebs, that's for men!"
9,22,phoebe:," no, i know, this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i'm gonna smell like another guy. yeah. "
9,22,phoebe:," ok. oh good, i'm dating a russian cab driver. . seriously does anyone buy this? i smell like beets!"
9,22,charlie:," so, you know what, i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. where do you think those would be?"
9,22,rachel:," on melanie griffith in ""working girl"". i think what you want is over here."
9,22,charlie:," see, i told you i needed someone! oh, you know, by the way, as a ""thank you"", i would really love to take you out."
9,22,rachel:, really?
9,22,charlie:," yeah! actually joey and i are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?"
9,22,rachel:," oh, i can't. because i i've seen them."
9,22,charlie:, you've seen all the movies...
9,22,rachel:," yeah! i'm a big fan! of the movies, you know. motion pictures. the talkies!"
9,22,phoebe:," hey rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
9,22,rachel:, sure!
9,22,phoebe:, ok!
9,22,charlie:," wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!"
9,22,rachel:, you know that depends on what it is! i've done a lot of stuff. 
9,22,phoebe:," so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie?"
9,22,rachel:," she's ok, i just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
9,22,phoebe:, why?
9,22,rachel:," i don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance!"
9,22,phoebe:, who else?
9,22,rachel:," anybody! you, me, you know, monica's mom..."
9,22,phoebe:, you like joey?
9,22,rachel:," shhhhh! phoebe! all right, look. i have a little thing for him."
9,22,phoebe:, oh my god!
9,22,rachel:," it's just physical and i have it totally under control! ok? it's just, when i see them together, sometimes i just get a little jealous!"
9,22,phoebe:," uh, wow! isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"
9,22,rachel:," oh, i get it!"
9,22,phoebe:," oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
9,22,rachel:," i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal."
9,22,phoebe:, yeah.
9,22,rachel:, so can we keep this between us?
9,22,phoebe:, sure!
9,22,rachel:," ok, great, because i gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!"
9,22,phoebe:, oh. 
9,22,phoebe:, any chance charlie has a deaf twin? 
9,22,monica:, hi honey!
9,22,chandler:," hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work!"
9,22,monica:," oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, zack!"
9,22,zack:, you too.
9,22,chandler:," you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite! go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer."
9,22,monica:, i got it.
9,22,zack:, thanks.
9,22,chandler:," so, zack's pretty nice, uh?"
9,22,monica:," yeah, i guess."
9,22,chandler:," so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
9,22,monica:, excuse me?
9,22,chandler:," well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
9,22,monica:," chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! ""come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm""!"
9,22,chandler:," no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
9,22,monica:, chandler!
9,22,chandler:," i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go!"
9,22,monica:, i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
9,22,chandler:, ok!
9,22,monica:, uh!
9,22,chandler:, zack!
9,22,zack:, thanks! do you have a coaster? i don't wanna make a ring. 
9,22,monica:," tell me about yourself, zack! "
9,22,rachel:," oh, god, do you think she heard? it would be so bad if she heard!"
9,22,phoebe:," well, maybe she didn't hear! ok i'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and i'll talk and see if you can hear me."
9,22,rachel:," ok, great! "
9,22,rachel:," oh, thank god i can't hear a word that you're saying!"
9,22,phoebe:, i didn't say anything yet!
9,22,rachel:," well, get back in there and talk!"
9,22,phoebe:, i'm rachel. it's so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
9,22,rachel:, what!?
9,22,phoebe:," well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
9,22,rachel:," ok well, i heard that! which means that she heard it too!"
9,22,phoebe:, ooh! we have a problem.
9,22,rachel:, oh! what are we gonna do? 
9,22,stranger:, just be honest with her.
9,22,rachel:, oh my god!
9,22,stranger:, and it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
9,22,rachel:, alright! enough out of you! 
9,22,joey:, hello?
9,22,ross:," joey! hey, i need to talk to charlie. is she there?"
9,22,joey:, no. no... eh... she went shopping with rachel. why? what's up?
9,22,ross:, i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
9,22,joey:, oh! how's it going?
9,22,ross:," it could be better! he, uhm... he fell asleep!"
9,22,joey:, what!? but i already bought my ticket to bermuda!
9,22,ross:, barbados.
9,22,joey:," fine, i'll rent a car and drive...! ross, you have to get that job!"
9,22,ross:, what am i supposed to do? he's out cold! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder.
9,22,joey:," well, just wake him up!"
9,22,ross:," i can't! if he realizes that i'm the one that put him to sleep, i won't get the job!"
9,22,joey:," uh! that's a tough one. oh! wait a minute, this happened to me before! yeah, i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... yeah i mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!? "
9,22,monica:, hey guys! dinner's ready!
9,22,zack:, oh! i'm gonna go wash up first. thanks!
9,22,chandler:," so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
9,22,monica:," ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!"
9,22,chandler:, you don't like him.
9,22,monica:, i think he is fine! it's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
9,22,chandler:, alright! just follow my lead! 
9,22,zack:, you guys have such a great place here.
9,22,chandler:," oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
9,22,zack:, uhm... no. although i did have an uncle who voted for dukakis.
9,22,chandler:, that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.
9,22,zack:," okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet."
9,22,monica:, do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
9,22,zack:, no...
9,22,monica:," eh... heart disease, alzheimers, gout?"
9,22,zack:," you guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?"
9,22,monica:, we're just making conversation. 
9,22,zack:, ok. i heard a joke today. it's pretty funny...
9,22,chandler:, you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness 
9,22,zack:, sure! alright...
9,22,zack:, ravioli's delicious!
9,22,chandler:, i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?
9,22,zack:, no i didn't.
9,22,monica:, yess!! 
9,22,chandler:, we're teeth people zack! 
9,22,rachel:, alright! let's just do it. let's just go over there and see if she heard.
9,22,phoebe:, good plan.
9,22,rachel:, ok. wha...? where? where are you going?
9,22,phoebe:," oh! i'm sorry rachel, i don't have time for your childish games, ok? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at ""who's more over who""! "
9,22,rachel:," hey, hi! hey, where've you been?"
9,22,charlie:, oh! trying on clothes.
9,22,rachel:," oh! wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? well, that's so weird! phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. god it's just such a small world!"
9,22,charlie:, rachel... i heard you guys whispering.
9,22,rachel:," oh god. you did. you heard. ok, listen, let me explain."
9,22,charlie:, no! there's nothing to explain. i heard you. phoebe likes joey.
9,22,rachel:, yeah.
9,22,charlie:," it's just that... i don't understand it... i mean, phoebe likes joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?"
9,22,rachel:," yeah! that's phoebe. that's phoebe. you know, she just wants them all! it's like she's a nympho!"
9,22,charlie:, wow!
9,22,rachel:, yeah...
9,22,charlie:," you know, by the way. i heard you tell her not to do anything. thanks for sticking up for me. you are such a nice person."
9,22,rachel:, i try... 
9,22,ross:, you're welcome. 
9,22,joey:, wow! you look... ... stop eating hot! which is like the highest level of hotness!
9,22,phoebe:, are you sure? because i'm really dreading going to this party.
9,22,joey:, then don't go!
9,22,phoebe:," mike knows i'm coming, and if i don't show up he'll think it's because of him! and i don't want to lose face! that's a very serious thing in my culture."
9,22,joey:," alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike. and afterward you come to my place and i'll get you good and drunk!"
9,22,phoebe:," you got it! ok. but not on the wine that you made, ok, because i just don't want to go back to the emergency room. "
9,22,phoebe:, david? 
9,22,david:, phoebe! hi!
9,22,phoebe:, oh my god! 
9,22,david:," wow, you look unbelievable."
9,22,phoebe:, yeah. what what are you doing here?
9,22,david:," well, i'm back from minsk... permanently."
9,22,phoebe:, what happened?
9,22,david:," well, remember how i was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?"
9,22,phoebe:, yeah?
9,22,david:," well, after eight years of research i discovered that it can't be done."
9,22,phoebe:," well, it's great that you're back! how are you?"
9,22,david:," good, good, life is good..."
9,22,phoebe:, good!
9,22,david:," ah well, i i'm seeing someone."
9,22,phoebe:," oh, good for you."
9,22,david:," she's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, i mean, i saw what you had with that mike guy, and i just said ""boy, i want that""."
9,22,phoebe:, mike and i broke up.
9,22,david:," you're kidding me. because i'm not seeing anybody, i've just totally made that up."
9,22,phoebe:, really?
9,22,david:," yeah, i don't know why, i'm sorry, i guess i just didn't want to lose face."
9,22,phoebe:," i understand. yeah. ok so then ok, so we're both living in new york, not seeing anyone. that's so not like us!"
9,22,david:," yeah, i know. well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?"
9,22,phoebe:, well... no.
9,22,david:, do you wanna get a drink?
9,22,phoebe:, i'd love to.
9,22,david:, great.
9,22,phoebe:, ok. 
9,22,david:, do you smell beets?
9,22,phoebe:," oh, got it, stay upwind of me. "
9,22,charlie:," hey, there's phoebe! is that mike she's with?"
9,22,rachel:," no, that's david."
9,22,charlie:, there's a third guy?
9,22,rachel:, tip of the iceberg. 
9,22,zack:," i'm gonna take off now. you're gonna let me go home, aren't you?"
9,22,chandler:, you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
9,22,zack:," no, no, i should get home, i'm kinda tired."
9,22,chandler:," are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
9,22,zack:, no it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. i'll see you tomorrow.
9,22,chandler:, ok. 
9,22,chandler:, i think we've found our sperm!
9,22,monica:, does seem pretty perfect.
9,22,chandler:," yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?"
9,22,monica:, no.
9,22,chandler:," why not, just because his great grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
9,22,monica:," no, that's not it. it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."
9,22,chandler:," yeah, he's better!"
9,22,monica:," no, he's not. and if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
9,22,chandler:, really? are you sure?
9,22,monica:," yeah, i'm sure."
9,22,chandler:," thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
9,22,monica:, that is so sweet. i love you. 
9,22,chandler:, so you know this leaves us with...
9,22,monica:, adoption.
9,22,chandler:, how do you feel about that?
9,22,monica:, i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it.
9,22,chandler:, me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
9,22,monica:," so this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
9,22,chandler:, yeah.
9,22,monica:," oh my god, we're gonna be parents!"
9,22,chandler:, we are gonna be great parents.
9,22,monica:," right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived."
9,22,chandler:," wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking! closing credits "
9,22,chandler:," hey, zack!"
9,22,zack:, hey chandler.
9,22,chandler:," look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
9,22,zack:, no you didn't.
9,22,chandler:, really?
9,22,zack:, no you did.
9,22,chandler:," my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it. "
9,22,jeanette:, here are the boards for friday's pitch .
9,22,zack:," oh, thank you. "
9,22,chandler:," you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
9,23,joey:, hey! i'm all packed and ready to go!
9,23,ross:," oh, that's right! daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today. we're going to a conference in barbados, right?"
9,23,joey:, mmh mmh.
9,23,ross:, can you say barbados?
9,23,joey:, barbados!
9,23,ross:," ok, i gotta say. i mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! uh! and i've a surprise, uh... i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! that's right! this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars."
9,23,rachel:, do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
9,23,chandler:," yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
9,23,phoebe:, i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
9,23,ross:," oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
9,23,phoebe:," no, no, because, you know, he's been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
9,23,ross:," ok, we gotta go, yeah? so, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
9,23,joey:," all right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally."
9,23,ross:," it's a blanket joe, not a cloak of invisibility! opening credits "
9,23,charlie:, wow! this place is beautiful!

9,23,joey:," i think i've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
9,23,woman:," doctor geller, i'm such a huge fan!"
9,23,joey:, that... never happens...
9,23,woman:," i've been following your career for years, i i can't wait for your keynote speech."

9,23,sarah:, are you a paleontologist?
9,23,joey:," no, god, no! no! no no, i'm an actor. you'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""the days of our lives""."
9,23,ross:," dude, it's just ""days of our lives""... there's no the."
9,23,joey:," ok, ross! it's... it's fun, yeah! no, i i play doctor drake ramoray."

9,23,joey:, you don't own a tv? what's all your furniture pointed at?? 
9,23,monica:," david, can you help me?! i'm trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air."
9,23,david:," oh, certainly. that's a combination of bernoulli's principle and newton's third law of motion."
9,23,monica:, see?
9,23,chandler:," yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
9,23,monica:," alright, i'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
9,23,phoebe:," oh, i should go, too. oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there. "
9,23,phoebe:, mike?? who's mike?
9,23,david:, mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
9,23,phoebe:," that's right! oh, yeah... well, i've totally forgotten about im! ah! that's that's... a blast from the past!"
9,23,david:, it's ok. ho honest mistake.
9,23,phoebe:," really, it doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time!"
9,23,chandler:, she does?
9,23,monica:, let's get you out of here!! 
9,23,monica:, at least you took me down with you!
9,23,phoebe:," i'm sooo sorry!! i just... i keep thinking about mike! i'm crazy about david, and we're having so much fun together. why why do i miss mike? that's that's gonna go away, right?"
9,23,monica:," i guess, in time."
9,23,phoebe:, yeah.
9,23,monica:," i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone."
9,23,phoebe:," you just did it again. chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone! "
9,23,david:," well, phoebe's still pretty hung up on that mike, uh?"
9,23,chandler:, i wouldn't read too much into it.
9,23,david:," still you know, a girl calls you by your ex boyfriend's name, that that's not a good thing, right?"
9,23,chandler:," david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
9,23,david:," sorry, i just... i wish there was something i could do, you know? well, you know phoebe..."
9,23,chandler:," seriously, we're gonna do this?"
9,23,david:," i'm sorry, uh... i just wish i could make her forget about mike already, you know... why did phoebe and mike break up?"
9,23,chandler:," oh, because his penis was too big. oh, i'm sorry, that's the kind of thing i do. they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
9,23,david:, that's great! that's great! i i'll propose to her!
9,23,chandler:, what?
9,23,david:," well, i was probably going to do it at some point."
9,23,chandler:, i didn't mean now...
9,23,david:," why not? it's brilliant! goodbye mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... thank you, chandler. sincerely."
9,23,chandler:," well, you're welcome! glad i could help."
9,23,david:, how do you think i should propose?
9,23,chandler:," david, i'm pretending to read here!! "
9,23,joey:, yeah! how you doin'? yeah alright! 
9,23,joey:," hey, hey! you said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
9,23,charlie:, i didn't mean a thong... i meant thongs...
9,23,joey:, you really should have been more clear about that! 
9,23,ross:, hey!
9,23,joey:, hey!
9,23,ross:, you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs!
9,23,joey:, oh! ah! eh... britney spears!?
9,23,ross:," yeah, she never misses these conferences! no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz!"
9,23,charlie:, oh my god! did you talk to him?
9,23,ross:, yeah... what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz?
9,23,joey:," ""hey kenny, how come you're not britney spears?"" "
9,23,ross:, ready to go?
9,23,charlie:, yeah!
9,23,joey:, wha...? you're gonna go now? i thought we could hang out?
9,23,charlie:, oh i can't... i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech.
9,23,ross:, yeah.
9,23,charlie:, but maybe we can have dinner later? on the balcony? will be romantic.
9,23,joey:, will you wear a thong?
9,23,charlie:, i will if you will.
9,23,joey:, oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
9,23,ross:," i'm good, i have dinner plans ."
9,23,charlie:, so you'll be ok?
9,23,joey:," yeah, yeah. i've got tons of stuff i could do. i'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
9,23,ross:," uh, joe, have you looked outside?"
9,23,joey:," no, why? "
9,23,joey:, oh man!
9,23,charlie:," there's an indoor pool, you can swim there! "
9,23,joey:," i wasn't gonna swim, i was gonna dig a hole! "
9,23,monica:, wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david.
9,23,chandler:," i do! want a hint? huh? ""i do"" ""i do""."
9,23,monica:," ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
9,23,chandler:, david is going to propose to phoebe.
9,23,monica:, what? why?
9,23,chandler:," be cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married."
9,23,monica:," chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"
9,23,chandler:," i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?"
9,23,monica:," they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say ""no"", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again."
9,23,chandler:," man, that's some bad advice! "
9,23,joey:, oh! hey! thank god you guys are here!
9,23,rachel:, hey! hey what's going on?
9,23,joey:," everything is upside down here! it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous! "
9,23,rachel:," alright, i don't wanna alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed! "
9,23,monica:," ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!"
9,23,chandler:, that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!
9,23,joey:," come on, i'll show you guys where to check in "
9,23,monica:," oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed!"
9,23,phoebe:," oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling!"
9,23,monica:, and make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
9,23,rachel:," ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. that's all, i just wish i could share that with a guy."
9,23,phoebe:, not joey.
9,23,rachel:," not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler."
9,23,monica:," yeah, right! "
9,23,david:," so, ehm... i'm proposing to pheobe tonight. "
9,23,chandler:," tonight?! isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? oh, there it is!"
9,23,david:," yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. that's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. and the clarity is uhm... is quite poor."
9,23,chandler:, nice! 
9,23,chandler:," monica, can i talk to you for a sec? "
9,23,monica:, ok!
9,23,chandler:, david is going to propose to phoebe tonight!
9,23,monica:, see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to?
9,23,chandler:, that would be advice!!
9,23,monica:, ok fine. i'll handle this. phoebe?
9,23,phoebe:, yeah?
9,23,monica:, i need to talk to you.
9,23,phoebe:," are you leaving ""the supremes""? "
9,23,monica:," ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. look, david is going to propose to you tonight."
9,23,phoebe:, wow? really? that's fantastic!
9,23,monica:, what are you serious? you wanna marry him? wha... what about mike?
9,23,phoebe:," ""mike, do you take phoebe..."" you know, it's every girl's dream!"
9,23,monica:, do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
9,23,phoebe:," i love mike... david! david. i love david. don't look at me that way, roseanne rosannadanna! "
9,23,ross:," by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century."
9,23,charlie:, it's great. you're gonna be the hit of the conference.
9,23,ross:," oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i won't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. ."
9,23,joey:, hey guys!
9,23,ross:, the chocolates aren't here yet.
9,23,joey:, damnit!
9,23,charlie:, ross just read me his speech. it's fantastic!
9,23,chandler:," oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...?"
9,23,ross:," if you want to check your email, just ask! "
9,23,chandler:, what? may i?
9,23,rachel:," what's with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."
9,23,charlie:, actually the wet season is june to december.
9,23,rachel:, it's not the time charlie.
9,23,chandler:," oh, no, no, no dear god, no!"
9,23,joey:," oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? oh! secret teapot?"
9,23,chandler:," your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone!"
9,23,ross:, wha... what do you mean? 
9,23,chandler:, it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.
9,23,ross:," what, oh my god. what did you do?"
9,23,chandler:, someone i don't know sent me an e mail and i opened it.
9,23,ross:," why, why would you open it?"
9,23,chandler:," well, it didn't say ""this is a virus""!!"
9,23,ross:, what did it say?
9,23,chandler:, nude... ... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry.
9,23,ross:," what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler!"
9,23,chandler:," it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right?"
9,23,ross:, no! i don't!!
9,23,chandler:," well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...! "
9,23,joey:, it's really gone?
9,23,ross:, yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
9,23,chandler:, i just feel awful.
9,23,ross:," yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
9,23,chandler:," well, i tried billy jean king, but... you know, you and monica have the same ""i'm gonna kill you"" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her... "
9,23,ross:, get out! 
9,23,rachel:," you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work."
9,23,ross:," well, what do you do?"
9,23,rachel:," well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer."
9,23,ross:, i can't believe this. i can't believe this is happening. i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! ok? i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i gonna say?
9,23,joey:, i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions.
9,23,ross:," i don't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now, joe!"
9,23,charlie:," ross, we can solve this. i just heard your speech. we can recreate it! we've got all night!"
9,23,ross:, wha... what you really think we can do that?
9,23,charlie:," oh wait, joey and i are supposed to have dinner ."
9,23,joey:," hey don't worry about that! i mean, ross needs you! and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can."
9,23,rachel:, ugh.
9,23,ross:," alright, ok, let's do it. uhm, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era, the breakup of pangea, hello! and then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the triassic."
9,23,joey:," oh, oh! any chance any of this happened in a ""galaxy far, far away""? . "
9,23,mike:, hello?
9,23,monica:," ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""i never want to get married"" thing and step up!"
9,23,mike:, who is this?
9,23,monica:," this is monica! i'm phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but i know she really wants to be with you!"
9,23,mike:, he... he's gonna propose?
9,23,monica:," i... i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair! "
9,23,mike:," look, if phoebe wants to marry david, she should, i'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you."
9,23,monica:," you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity? damnit! "
9,23,monica:," well, i hope you're happy!"
9,23,chandler:," oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey!"
9,23,monica:," phoebe is going to say ""yes"" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
9,23,chandler:," phoebe is going to say ""yes""? that's, that's great!"
9,23,monica:," no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike!"
9,23,chandler:, and there's not chance that will work?
9,23,monica:," no, i called him. it's not gonna happen."
9,23,chandler:, oooooooh! meddler! meddler!
9,23,monica:," well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un meddle the thing that you meddled up in the first place!"
9,23,chandler:, this vacation sucks!! 
9,23,joey:," i'm so bored! stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
9,23,rachel:," well, i've brought some books. we could read."
9,23,joey:," hey, it hasn't come to that yet. "
9,23,joey:, hey hey hey! don't mind if i do!
9,23,waiter:," i'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention "
9,23,joey:," hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
9,23,rachel:, we can't. we're not pharmacists!
9,23,joey:," i know we're not, but frank medeio and... eva trorro... womba..."
9,23,rachel:, kate miller?
9,23,joey:, kate miller it is. 
9,23,rachel:, and... that's the most sex i'm gonna have this weekend.
9,23,joey:, in that case should i make sure it's on real good? 
9,23,rachel:, thank you. 
9,23,charlie:," and then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the mesozoic era in the 21st century."
9,23,ross:," yeah, that's it?"
9,23,charlie:, yeah.
9,23,ross:," oh my god, we did it! "
9,23,charlie:, actually i did it ross. you remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
9,23,ross:," yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products. this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. that's a pretty necklace."
9,23,charlie:, thank you.
9,23,ross:," hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne? "
9,23,charlie:," oh yeah! hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you."
9,23,ross:," oh my god, i love you."
9,23,charlie:," oh, this is such a cute picture of emma. and is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?"
9,23,ross:," that's ben, my son from my first marriage."
9,23,charlie:, your first marriage?
9,23,ross:, yeah.
9,23,charlie:, you're married more than once?
9,23,ross:, no. 
9,23,charlie:," so, why did you break up?"
9,23,ross:," oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? she... she was... eh... gay."
9,23,charlie:," oh my god, this is so cool!"
9,23,ross:," ok, odd thing to get excited about!"
9,23,charlie:," no, it's just... i was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!"
9,23,ross:, hey! high five! 
9,23,charlie:, didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? my fiancÃ© was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
9,23,ross:, my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. she didn't get any fitter.
9,23,charlie:," ""oh, i knew all along"""
9,23,ross:," ""hi, i just dropped by to say your wife's gay"""
9,23,charlie:, i know!
9,23,ross:," and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
9,23,charlie:, i didn't do that.
9,23,ross:, me neither. 
9,23,joey:," well, who knew? pharmacists are fun."
9,23,rachel:," i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home."
9,23,joey:," not enough pills in the world, rach. what about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
9,23,rachel:," well, let's see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."
9,23,joey:," but what about back home, anything going on there? anybody you like?"
9,23,rachel:, no.
9,23,joey:," there it is, you're blushing!"
9,23,rachel:," no, i'm not blushing, i'm sunburnt! from, you know, the rain."
9,23,joey:, you like someone. tell me who it is. who is it? 
9,23,rachel:, no.
9,23,joey:, tell me who it is.
9,23,rachel:, joey! 
9,23,joey:," come on who? who do you like? tell me. you're not getting away that easy. who do you like, who?"
9,23,rachel:," joey, come on! it doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."
9,23,joey:," what? why not? rach, who can you not get?"
9,23,rachel:," oh! ok. ok, you really wanna know who it is?"
9,23,joey:," yeah, who is that?"
9,23,rachel:, do ya?
9,23,joey:, hey! 
9,23,charlie:," i just left you a message! ross and i were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner."
9,23,joey:," right, of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech?"
9,23,ross:," yep, we got it, we got it. thank you so much."
9,23,charlie:, i had a great time.
9,23,joey:," alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because i really wanna know who..."
9,23,rachel:, later! la...
9,23,charlie:," so, shall we?"
9,23,joey:, yeah. 
9,23,rachel:," ok. see you, bye."
9,23,charlie:, bye.
9,23,ross:, good night.
9,23,joey:," ok, good night! "
9,23,monica:, i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike.
9,23,chandler:," you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that. "
9,23,david:," uh, phoebe, uh, i have... something i wanna say."
9,23,monica:," oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go."
9,23,chandler:," i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk? ""uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..."" spit it out, david!"
9,23,david:," uh, phoebe, uh... you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn't help!"
9,23,phoebe:," sure, ok, yeah."
9,23,david:," but well, now that we're together again, i don't ever want to be apart. so, to that end... "
9,23,phoebe:," oh my god, mike!"
9,23,david:," it's david, actually!"
9,23,phoebe:," no, mike's here."
9,23,david:, hi mike!
9,23,mike:, hi david. chandler. monica... oh!
9,23,monica:, it's the humidity!
9,23,mike:, hi phoebe.
9,23,phoebe:," what are you, what are you doing here?"
9,23,mike:, i have a question i need to ask you.
9,23,david:, i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself.
9,23,mike:," yeah, i understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this."
9,23,david:," ok, would you care for my seat as well?"
9,23,mike:," actually yeah, that'll be great."
9,23,david:," that's fair, you've had a long trip. "
9,23,mike:," phoebe, i love you. i mean, i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason, but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you."
9,23,david:, kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say.
9,23,mike:," sorry david, but she really has to know this."
9,23,david:," alright, but after this i want to see you outside. if the rain stops."
9,23,monica:," you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you? now, i don't actually have a ring..."
9,23,david:, i have a ring.
9,23,chandler:," i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
9,23,david:," phoebe, will you marry me?"
9,23,phoebe:, no!
9,23,david:, uhm... ha ha!
9,23,phoebe:," i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."
9,23,mike:, we can have any future you want. 
9,23,david:," ok, i'm gonna take off."
9,23,phoebe:," david, i'm so sorry, i'm sorry."
9,23,david:," just so i know, if i had asked first..."
9,23,phoebe:," yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."
9,23,david:," please, you don't have to explain. i mean, perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us. and i wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. it was a good trip! "
9,23,mike:, is it ok if i hug you now?
9,23,phoebe:, yes! 
9,23,monica:, because of our meddling! alright? 
9,23,chandler:," oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day."
9,23,monica:, i know 
9,23,rachel:, open your drapes! open your drapes!
9,23,chandler:, i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms! 
9,23,monica:, the sun is out!
9,23,chandler:, hey! remember when i had corneas?
9,23,monica:," ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion."
9,23,chandler:, ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
9,23,rachel:, nooo!
9,23,monica:, damn it!
9,23,ross:," walls are pretty thin, guys! "
9,23,ross:, then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
9,23,rachel:," look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, i'm so jealous!"
9,23,ross:," gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus..."
9,23,chandler:, not to mention the cold sores. 
9,23,ross:," and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development. "
9,23,chandler:, really?
9,23,ross:," but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus... "
9,23,charlie:, what?
9,23,joey:," he said ""erectus""!"
9,23,charlie:," you're... you're kidding, right?"
9,23,joey:," no, he really said it."
9,23,ross:, ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus... 
9,23,joey:, erectus?
9,23,rachel:, homo. 
9,23,ross:, ... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. thank you! 
9,23,ross:, i thought... it was wonderful!
9,23,ross:," jarvis oberblau, cornell. i mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... ."
9,23,ross:, ok... now... now we're just holding hands! 
9,23,rachel:," all right! well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?"
9,23,monica:, yeah!
9,23,rachel:, it was really... great!
9,23,ross:," oh, thank you so much!"
9,23,joey:," yeah, and so funny!"
9,23,rachel:, oh! 
9,23,ross:," ok!... all right, thanks! thank you so much, you guys! oh, i can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"
9,23,mike:," you're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it! "
9,23,mike:, oh... i'm back!
9,23,ross:, yeah! 
9,23,ross:, hey! well...? 
9,23,charlie:, you were incredible!
9,23,ross:, yeah?
9,23,charlie:, you blew them away!
9,23,ross:," oh, i can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! i mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?"
9,23,charlie:, i was not!
9,23,ross:," no, it's ok! made me feel like a rock star!"
9,23,charlie:, oh my god! i'm your groupie!
9,23,ross:, i'd better not found you naked in my hotel room! 
9,23,ross:," look, i took it too far! "
9,23,monica:," i can't believe it's raining again! oh, it's so unfair!!! "
9,23,phoebe:," well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. not you guys. you got it going on! "
9,23,monica:," so, what are we gonna do today?"
9,23,mike:, they have a game room downstairs! ping pong and stuff.
9,23,monica:," ping pong? honey, they have ping pong! let's play!"
9,23,chandler:, i don't think so!
9,23,monica:, why not?
9,23,chandler:," because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying!"
9,23,monica:, i'm not always that bad!
9,23,chandler:," oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?"
9,23,monica:, i punched you...?
9,23,chandler:, and...?
9,23,monica:, ... phoebe...?
9,23,phoebe:, ... and...?
9,23,monica:, i clunked your heads together! 
9,23,charlie:, hey! there you are!
9,23,joey:," hey! as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! "
9,23,charlie:," i'm sorry, i can't! i'm running a discussion group all afternoon."
9,23,joey:," oh... oh, but that's ok, i'll find someone else to do it... i'll do it alone, but... i don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."
9,23,charlie:, you know... i feel so bad! i haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night...
9,23,joey:," hey! don't worry about it! it was fine! i ended up having the best time with rachel! i just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on ross's speech... "
9,23,charlie:," actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!"
9,23,joey:," oh! oh, well! at least we're both having fun!"
9,23,charlie:, yeah... 
9,23,charlie:, ... is it weird that it's not with each other?
9,23,joey:," yeah! a little bit, yeah..."
9,23,charlie:, i think we need to talk...! 
9,23,joey:, yeah... i think we do... ... about what? 
9,23,monica:," c'mon guys, it'll be fun!"
9,23,phoebe:," all right, all right... i'll play if we don't keep score!"
9,23,monica:, but then how do we know who wins?
9,23,phoebe:, nobody wins!
9,23,monica:," so, we're just four losers... super!"
9,23,chandler:, i'm not playing with you.
9,23,phoebe:," yeah, i'm out."
9,23,mike:, i'll play ya!
9,23,monica:, ok!
9,23,phoebe:," mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!"
9,23,chandler:, she gets crazy! this scar is from pictionary! 
9,23,mike:, i think i will be all right! you wanna volley a bit for a serve?
9,23,monica:, sure! got to! 
9,23,monica:, aww!
9,23,mike:," oh, by the way... i'm awesome!!"
9,23,chandler:," oh dear god, there's two of them!"
9,23,mike:, you're ready to play?
9,23,monica:," hell, yeah!"
9,23,chandler:, did you know this about him?
9,23,phoebe:, no idea! i though he was soft like you!
9,23,mike:, wanna make it more interesting?
9,23,monica:, how much were you thinking?
9,23,mike:, ten bucks a game?
9,23,monica:, make it fifty!
9,23,mike:, i'll make it a hundred!
9,23,monica:, one thousand...
9,23,chandler:, ok!
9,23,mike:," to see who goes first, you got a quarter?"
9,23,monica:, no... either of you girls got a quarter?
9,23,chandler:," honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
9,23,phoebe:," monica, you call it."
9,23,monica:," heads! no, tails! he he heads!"
9,23,phoebe:, tails!
9,23,monica:," ow, what are the chances! "
9,23,monica:, ha! my point!
9,23,mike:," oh, no! i don't think so! you know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point."
9,23,phoebe:," ... all these coasts having beautiful weather. in new york, it's 72 and sunny!"
9,23,rachel:, oh! weather bitch! 
9,23,rachel:," it's open! hi, joe!"
9,23,joey:, hey...
9,23,rachel:," what, is everything ok?"
9,23,joey:, uh... charlie and i broke up.
9,23,rachel:," nooooo, why?"
9,23,joey:," oh well, she said we have nothing in common."
9,23,rachel:," oh, that's crazy!"
9,23,joey:," no, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
9,23,rachel:," ... yeah, it's true."
9,23,joey:," i mean, she should be with someone like... ross! you know what i mean, he uses all those big words too! man, smart people are dull!"
9,23,rachel:," what, hey!"
9,23,joey:," ok, rach! "
9,23,joey:," i feel so stupid, you know? why... why do i keep going after the wrong girls?"
9,23,rachel:," w what are you, what are you talking about?"
9,23,joey:," oh, c'mon, i mean, there's you, then there's charlie, and it's like... what the hell is my problem? oh! "
9,23,rachel:, ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
9,23,joey:," i'm telling you, rach, charlie is not right for me!"
9,23,rachel:," yeah, i'm not talking about her..."
9,23,joey:, but then who? the waitress i went out with last month? 
9,23,rachel:, you know? forget it!
9,23,joey:," no no no no, no! who, who were you talking about?"
9,23,rachel:," no, i i i i don't, i actually don't know who i'm talking about! so!"
9,23,joey:," ok! all right, well... i'm gonna see if i can get a room for the night and i'll... i'll see you later!"
9,23,rachel:," yeah, sure! "
9,23,joey:, you like me? 
9,23,rachel:," ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"
9,23,joey:, that's a huge thing!
9,23,rachel:," lately i have been having thoughts musings, if you will!"
9,23,joey:, what... for how long?
9,23,rachel:, only like a month!
9,23,joey:, a month??
9,23,rachel:," what the... dial it down! listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes i do, i have, i've been thinking about... you know, us! ok, dial it up a little!"
9,23,joey:, i just have one question!
9,23,rachel:, shoot!
9,23,joey:, what the hell are you doin'???
9,23,rachel:," i don't know, i'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... i mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?..."
9,23,joey:," uh, am i curious? i mean, i am as curious as... as... george!!"
9,23,rachel:, who...?
9,23,joey:," curious george ! you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!"
9,23,rachel:," oh yes, of course, i remember him!"
9,23,joey:," yeah, he had a paper route."
9,23,rachel:," yeah, he did! oh, see, this is what i'm talking about!"
9,23,joey:," no, i know, yeah i know we're great but rach no... this... this can't happen!"
9,23,rachel:, but can it... just... happen a little bit?
9,23,joey:," no, no! it can't happen at all!"
9,23,rachel:," but why, why not?"
9,23,joey:," because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no! i couldn't do it to ross!"
9,23,rachel:, but that wasn't gonna stop you before!
9,23,joey:," i know, i know! but i've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... i'm sorry...!"
9,23,rachel:," i'm sorry, too! oh god! i shouldn't have said anything!"
9,23,joey:, no big deal!
9,23,rachel:, it's not a big deal!
9,23,joey:, no big deal!
9,23,rachel:, it's so not a big deal!
9,23,joey:, yeah! i'll see ya later! yeah!
9,23,rachel:, ok! 
9,23,rachel:," ok, i... "
9,23,rachel:, aaahhhh! 
9,23,monica:," ooh! i'm sorry! i think, i think, that may have missed the table!"
9,23,mike:, do you?
9,23,monica:," ah, yeah!"
9,23,mike:, do you?
9,23,monica:," ah, yeaaah!"
9,23,mike:, do you?
9,23,monica:, ah yeaaaah!
9,23,chandler:, do you really find this attractive on him?
9,23,phoebe:," oh, yeah! are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now? "
9,23,chandler:, i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one.
9,23,phoebe:," c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head! "
9,23,monica:," oh, damn it!"
9,23,phoebe:, i sleep with him!
9,23,mike:," game, point!"
9,23,monica:," don't get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"
9,23,mike:," you know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that. "
9,23,monica:," no, no, nooo!"
9,23,mike:, and that's how it's done! 
9,23,chandler:," okay dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner."
9,23,monica:, best out of three?
9,23,mike:, that's what i'm thinking.
9,23,chandler:, should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
9,23,monica:," serve the ball, chump!"
9,23,mike:," serve the ball, chump."
9,23,phoebe:," i'm just saying, i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!"
9,23,ross:," ooh, well. ah, i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. "
9,23,woman:," oh, you're back... this is my wife, nancy."
9,23,ross:, get out! 
9,23,charlie:," ross, can i talk to you for a minute?"
9,23,ross:," yes, please! so, what's going on?"
9,23,charlie:," uh, well... joey and i broke up."
9,23,ross:," oh my god, wh what happened?"
9,23,charlie:," joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! i mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!"
9,23,ross:, i knew that was him!
9,23,charlie:," anyway i just, uh, i think it's for the best."
9,23,ross:," hey, you ok?"
9,23,charlie:, i guess. there was hum... there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey. i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone else. 
9,23,paleontologist:," ok geller. last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker."

9,23,monica:," honey, you don't have to do this."

9,23,ross:," yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. you know, we as a group are not the coolest. "
9,23,ross:, i don't think they saw us.
9,23,charlie:, i don't think they did. 
9,23,charlie:," hum, so, i started to say you something earlier, hum... there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey. i kind of realized i... was starting to have feelings... for someone else."
9,23,ross:, oh. can i... can i ask who?
9,23,charlie:, i think you know.
9,23,ross:," i think i know too but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so... "
9,23,ross:, i'm sorry... we... we can't.
9,23,charlie:," all right, all right."
9,23,ross:," i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it'd be a really really bad idea. or or not! "
9,23,rachel:, what? end
10,1,monica:," oh, the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn on.you wanna...? "
10,1,chandler:," you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired."

10,1,phoebe:," well, okay, mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. and then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want... "
10,1,ross:, ... finally...
10,1,phoebe:, is that ross?
10,1,monica:," yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls."
10,1,phoebe:, sounds like he's with someone.
10,1,chandler:," he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push ups, and then talk to his triceps."
10,1,monica:," wait a minute, i think phoebe's right. you know i hear someone else in there with him. "
10,1,charlie:, ooh... dr. geller!
10,1,ross:," god, you're amazing... i didn't even have to ask you to call me that."
10,1,monica:," oh my god, that's charlie!"
10,1,chandler:, she's cheating on joey with ross!
10,1,phoebe:, oh that tart... floozy... giant...
10,1,monica:, i'm not sure about this.
10,1,phoebe:," yeah, you're right. this is none of our business."
10,1,monica:, no i'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. someone get me a glass!
10,1,phoebe:," oh, i'm not gonna do this, okay? i'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend."

10,1,rachel:," hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? what changed?"
10,1,joey:," well, i only said that because of ross, you know. then i saw him kissing charlie..."
10,1,rachel:," what? ross and charlie? wow! she's really making her way through the group, huh? ah, who am i to talk? "
10,1,monica:, i can't believe this. rachel and joey?

10,1,ross:, weh...*sigh*
10,1,charlie:, uhm... is everything okay?
10,1,ross:," yeah, it's just... i don't think i can do this..."
10,1,charlie:," ooh... is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because i saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... i could just..."
10,1,ross:," no, no! look, i need to talk to joey. i mean, you guys just broke up. before anything more happens between us, i need to know he's okay with it."
10,1,charlie:, i uhm... i completely understand.
10,1,ross:," alright, i'm gonna go find them... i just need a... need a before i can... you know. grandma... grandma... grandma... okay, i see you later."

10,1,joey:, no idea what it means.
10,1,rachel:," oh... okay, just hide!"
10,1,ross:, rach?
10,1,rachel:," coming! try under the bed, try under the bed! "

10,1,rachel:," yeah, sure... "
10,1,joey:, i don't believe this... have you guys been...
10,1,phoebe:, shhh... this is the listening side of the wall. 
10,1,ross:," and then she told me that she and joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me."
10,1,rachel:, uh huh... right... yeah...
10,1,ross:, and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her.
10,1,rachel:," oh, i know... i know it's been really hard for you."
10,1,ross:," anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. i mean, how angry do you think joey is gonna be?"
10,1,rachel:," that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say."
10,1,ross:," you know, i gotta go find him. he's gotta be here someplace."
10,1,rachel:, you would think! 
10,1,rachel:, joey!
10,1,joey:, is he gone?
10,1,rachel:, how are you doing this? 
10,1,joey:, pssst...
10,1,rachel:, ye ah!
10,1,phoebe:," now, what is this?"
10,1,rachel:," ah, what is this? well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth grade!"
10,1,phoebe:, oh no... have you thought about it how complicated this could get? what about ross?
10,1,joey:," well, he's with charlie now."
10,1,monica:," yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. and as his friend, i mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?"
10,1,joey:," you're a pain in my ass, geller!"
10,1,rachel:," all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it..."
10,1,chandler:," okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you?"
10,1,rachel:, sure...
10,1,chandler:, enunciate!
10,1,rachel:, get out! 
10,1,rachel:, are they right?
10,1,joey:," probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to ross."
10,1,rachel:," yeah... yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight."
10,1,joey:," yeah, i think that'd be best... so, so i'm gonna... i'm gonna take off..."

10,1,mike:, three months.
10,1,phoebe:," three months? okay... this is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?"
10,1,mike:, i'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. i promise.
10,1,phoebe:," oh, okay... good. you do that. and then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you."

10,1,phoebe:," you know what, we're gonna have sex. let's just leave it there. "
10,1,ross:," right, i'm gonna go talk to joey. i think this is the right time. he's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty free""."

10,1,rachel:," ah... well, obviously i think so too."
10,1,ross:," well, i'm so excited about this."
10,1,rachel:, really? excited?
10,1,ross:, are you kidding? i have had some very dirty dreams about this...
10,1,rachel:," excuse me! you didn't tell him, did you?"
10,1,joey:, i couldn't. he was saying all these really nice things about me. i didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. i'm on a edge on chandler.
10,1,rachel:," oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him."
10,1,joey:," thank you. yeah, i appreciate that. commercial break "

10,1,mike:," hey, it's mike."
10,1,phoebe:," ooh, that was fast."
10,1,mike:," oh, err... no, she's not here yet. you know, i think i'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone..."
10,1,phoebe:," yeah, you can't do that! oh, come on mike, strap on a pair.why don't you just tell her that we got back together. you know, women appreciate honesty. we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. just f.y.i."
10,1,mike:, one more thing... there... might be a picture of precious on my coffee table.
10,1,phoebe:, her name is precious? is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
10,1,mike:," anyway, i just wanna give you a heads up. "
10,1,phoebe:," okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. "
10,1,precious:," hi, i'm precious, who are you?"
10,1,phoebe:, i... i'm phoebe.
10,1,precious:," phoebe? mike's ex girlfriend phoebe, the love of his life? that phoebe?"

10,1,monica:," oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these... ow!"
10,1,chandler:," you go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
10,1,monica:, yeah!
10,1,chandler:," so if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
10,1,monica:," well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be able to do this. you like that, right? "
10,1,chandler:, what are you singing?
10,1,monica:," it's ""bolero"" from ""10""."
10,1,chandler:," the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them!"
10,1,monica:, you what? you said you liked them.
10,1,chandler:, did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp.
10,1,monica:," fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does."
10,1,chandler:," again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
10,1,monica:," you know what? i don't care. i like it like this, and i'm gonna keep it. you're just jealous because your hair can't do this... ouch!"
10,1,chandler:, hit yourself in the tooth?
10,1,monica:, and the eye! 
10,1,ross:," hi... there she is. hi emma. oh my god, i missed you. oh emma, i missed you so much. hey... did you have a good time with grandma green? huh? did she give you a bottle of anti depressants again to use as a rattle? "
10,1,rachel:," that was one time, ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams."
10,1,ross:," ooh hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? okay? i want you to wait right here. come here sweetie."

10,1,rachel:," okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal."
10,1,ross:, oh no!
10,1,rachel:, what? what is it?
10,1,ross:," oh, major shampoo explosion!"
10,1,rachel:," uh, look ross, this really isn't easy."
10,1,ross:," oh, it's all over everything. why? why me? "
10,1,rachel:, because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
10,1,ross:," i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you were saying?"
10,1,rachel:," well, yeah... okay, look it's about me and..."
10,1,ross:," oh, not another one! oh my g... and this is moisturiser. it's even harder to clean! why? why do bad things happen to good people?"
10,1,rachel:," wow! well, clearly this is not a good time."
10,1,ross:," duh, you think? "
10,1,phoebe:," okay, bye. alright, so mike's on his way over. see, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. point is... i'm gonna take off."
10,1,precious:," i'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. i mean, are you guys getting back together or something?"
10,1,phoebe:," alright... susie, can i call you susie?"
10,1,precious:, my name is precious.
10,1,phoebe:," yeah, i can't say that. uhm... susie, i'm gonna be straight with you... mike and i are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. and he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
10,1,precious:, i just can't believe this... why?
10,1,phoebe:," well, i don't..."
10,1,precious:," oh, why would he do this? i mean, what's wrong with me?"
10,1,phoebe:," nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
10,1,precious:," i mean, what the hell am i supposed to do now?"
10,1,phoebe:," damn it woman, pull yourself together! have some pride, for the love of god. "
10,1,phoebe:," okay, not a fan of the tough love."
10,1,precious:, i just can't believe that mike didn't give me any warning.
10,1,phoebe:," but he didn't really know, you know. he wasn't planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me..."
10,1,precious:, he proposed to you? this is the worst birthday ever. 
10,1,phoebe:," look, precious... mike's not worth this. you're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, mike's kind of a wang. i mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... he was gonna break up with you on your birthday? and, i don't like to kiss and tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
10,1,precious:," oh, my god, maybe you're right. maybe i don't need him. i deserve to be treated with respect. "
10,1,precious:," screw you, mike. you're a coward and a bastard, and i hope you rot in hell. "
10,1,phoebe:, you're welcome! 
10,1,chandler:," honey, you've been in there for a long time... is everything okay?"
10,1,monica:, not really. 
10,1,monica:, i have a problem.
10,1,chandler:, really? what happened?
10,1,monica:," well, i was dancing around, and singing ""no woman, no cry"" and i got stuck."
10,1,chandler:, you can't move at all?
10,1,monica:," oh, well, i can move... "
10,1,chandler:," if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?"
10,1,monica:, i guess so...
10,1,chandler:, some of these look a little frayed.
10,1,monica:," yeah, i tried to gnaw myself free. "
10,1,joey:, hey!
10,1,rachel:, hi!
10,1,joey:," so, did you err... did you tell ross?"
10,1,rachel:," well, i tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. so i guess now it's your turn again."
10,1,joey:," no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... i think it's better if you tell him, you know. it's easier for a woman. that way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... i didn't mean it. i'm so so ooory. "
10,1,rachel:," yeah, 'cause that's what we do."
10,1,joey:," alright, alright, okay, uhm... how 'bout this, how about this? tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together."
10,1,rachel:," okay, that sounds fair. it just means that once again we can't..."
10,1,joey:," i know, i know..., but that's okay. i mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals."
10,1,rachel:," no! of course we can wait. alright, so i guess that means good night then?"
10,1,joey:, yeah! good night! 
10,1,rachel:, goo ood night!
10,1,joey:, good night! 
10,1,rachel:," seriously, good night!"
10,1,joey:, stop saying good night.
10,1,rachel:, okay. commercial break 
10,1,monica:, look what i found in the drawer... and you said i'd never wear this...
10,1,chandler:," now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?"
10,1,monica:," sure, what do you have in mind?"
10,1,chandler:, i think you know.
10,1,monica:, really? i don't really feel like it.
10,1,chandler:, this is what i want to do.
10,1,monica:," okay, i just don't get why you like it so much."
10,1,chandler:," she's an fbi agent, posing as a beauty contestant."
10,2,joey:," okay, ross, i realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. let me explain, okay?"
10,2,rachel:, we weren't doing anything!
10,2,joey:," rach, he just saw us."
10,2,rachel:, shhh.
10,2,joey:," but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? one kiss."
10,2,rachel:," dude, chill! okay, we also kissed in barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? and the only reason that that happened was because i saw you kissing charlie."
10,2,rachel:," yeah, you started it! i've got to chill."
10,2,joey:," look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.."
10,2,rachel:," we feel so terrible about this, ross."
10,2,joey:," yeah, but it did happen, so... "
10,2,joey:, ross?
10,2,rachel:, ross? can we just close the door? opening credits 
10,2,rachel:," ross, say something. anything."
10,2,ross:, yeah.
10,2,ross:, and have you .. ed?
10,2,joey:," no, no, no!"
10,2,rachel:," no, no, no!"
10,2,ross:," but if i hadn't walked in here, would you..?"
10,2,joey:, probably. 
10,2,joey:," no, no!"
10,2,rachel:," ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. you have every right to go nuts."
10,2,ross:, i'm not going nuts. do you see me go nuts?
10,2,rachel:," no, but you know what i mean."
10,2,ross:," hey, hey, hey... if you two are happy, then i'm happy for you. i'm fine!"
10,2,joey:, really?
10,2,ross:," absolutely. i'm fine! totally fine. i don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, i'm fine. i'm not saying i wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. i mean, at first i was like.. but now that i've had time to absorb it; lovin' this."
10,2,joey:, ross..
10,2,ross:," it's all working out! me & charlie, and you two. you know what we should do?"
10,2,rachel:, calm ourselves?
10,2,ross:," no. we should all have dinner. yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. i'll cook!!"
10,2,joey:," look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
10,2,ross:," weird? what? what's weird? the only thing weird would be if someone didn't like mexican food, because i'm making fajitas!! "
10,2,joey:, i do like fajitas. 
10,2,monica:," god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there's inter country adoption, dependency adoption.. there are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives."
10,2,chandler:, there's a hair in my coffee. 
10,2,phoebe:, hey guys!
10,2,monica:, hey.
10,2,phoebe:," hey, have you seen frank jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets."
10,2,chandler:," you know, it's funny. every time you say ""triplets,"" i immediately think of three hot blonde 19 year olds. "
10,2,monica:, that's sweet. drink your hair.
10,2,phoebe:," hey, what's all this stuff?"
10,2,monica:," oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies."
10,2,phoebe:," ooh, babies! oh, this one is so cute, get this one!"
10,2,monica:, that's not really how it works.
10,2,phoebe:," oh, how does it work?"
10,2,monica:, i don't know!
10,2,phoebe:," well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, bill and colleen. they adopted a kid. i'm sure they'd help you."
10,2,monica:, that's not what we talked about!!
10,2,phoebe:, hey.
10,2,phoebe:," good to see you, too."
10,2,monica:," hi, how you doin'?"
10,2,monica:," oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big! "
10,2,monica:," ""willing to adopt triplets?"" no! "
10,2,joey:," ah, can i just say i know we're doing this for ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date."
10,2,rachel:," well, what would we be doing?"
10,2,joey:," i'd take you out for a romantic night. some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
10,2,rachel:, feel me up?
10,2,joey:, in a carriage! 
10,2,joey:," hey, charlie!"
10,2,rachel:, hey.
10,2,charlie:," hi, hi. so.. dreading this?"
10,2,rachel:," oh, you bet. "
10,2,joey:," so, did you bring a little something for ross?"
10,2,charlie:, actually.. it's stuff you left at my apartment.
10,2,joey:," oh. oh, thanks."
10,2,charlie:," and you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want."
10,2,joey:," yeah, i didn't throw any of that out.. "
10,2,ross:," i thought i heard voices! hi charlie! hi joey. and.. oh! you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. i'm just kidding, i know rachel, i know. come, please come in. come in."
10,2,rachel:," okay, well, we brought you some wine."
10,2,ross:, oh! that is so thoughtful. she's a keeper. and what did you bring me? 
10,2,joey:," uh, actually, that's.."
10,2,ross:," underwear, a toothbrush, and van halen cd. i can use all these things!!"
10,2,charlie:," gosh, ross, you know, you seem a little..."
10,2,ross:, what? fine? because i am! aren't you? aren't you? aren't you? you see? who else is fine?
10,2,joey:," okay, listen, hey, ross. why don't you try to relax, okay? maybe have a drink."
10,2,ross:, you know what? that is a very good idea. i'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas. 
10,2,phoebe:," yeah, i really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again."
10,2,phoebe:, yeah.
10,2,phoebe:, i haven't slept in four years!
10,2,phoebe:," you just don't know how hard it is, phoebe. there's just so many of them. you know, two i can handle. two's great. you just hold one in each hand, but what do i do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. i've got no more hands to protect my area! there's three of them, phoebe, three!"
10,2,phoebe:," sometimes i think that.. oh, no, no, no, i can't say it, it's too horrible. no."
10,2,phoebe:," no, i can't."
10,2,phoebe:," oh, no! i would never do that. no. i just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one."
10,2,phoebe:, what?! you can't separate them! that's terrible. which one? 
10,2,monica:, thank you so much for seeing us. phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
10,2,colleen:," oh, please, we're happy to help."
10,2,bill:, we went through the same thing when we were adopting.
10,2,chandler:," so, a lot of malfunctioning wee wees and hoo hoos in this room, huh? "
10,2,chandler:," i mean, you have a lovely home."
10,2,monica:," well, we appreciate anything you can tell us."
10,2,colleen:," well, actually, i think this might help. "
10,2,colleen:, it's pretty much all the information you need.
10,2,monica:, oh my god!
10,2,colleen:," everything is broken down into categories, and then cross referenced, and then colour coded to correspond with the forms in the back."
10,2,monica:, thank you. i think i just had a tiny orgasm.
10,2,bill:," i know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us."
10,2,chandler:, that's great. can i see the book? 
10,2,chandler:," you want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
10,2,monica:, it's.. it's just so pretty and white.
10,2,colleen:," the bathroom is down the hall, to your left. "
10,2,colleen:, i would have told him to do it too.
10,2,monica:, can i adopt you? 
10,2,chandler:," hey, you must be owen."
10,2,owen:, yeah.
10,2,chandler:," i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too."
10,2,owen:, you were?
10,2,chandler:," yeah, in fact my father was a den mother."
10,2,owen:, huh?
10,2,chandler:, you know how to use a compass?
10,2,owen:, i have a badge in it.
10,2,chandler:, you do? that's fantastic!
10,2,owen:, you wanna see it?
10,2,chandler:," i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your parents. they're telling us all about how they adopted you."
10,2,owen:, what?!?
10,2,chandler:, what?
10,2,owen:, i'm adopted? 
10,2,chandler:, i got nothing. 
10,2,ross:," the first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood."
10,2,rachel:," well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some."
10,2,ross:," oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? you know? just the four of us. just hangin'."
10,2,joey:," dude, are you okay? and when are the fajitas gonna be ready?"
10,2,ross:," i'm fine! hey, i'm great! i'm just.. i'm just proud of us. there's no weirdness, no tension."
10,2,rachel:, no awareness.
10,2,ross:," we make a great foursome. we should do more stuff together. ooh! let's take a trip. okay, where do you think we we can go? "
10,2,ross:, my fajitas!! 
10,2,rachel:," look, charlie, i just want you to know. ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me. you know, he normally doesn't drink like this."
10,2,charlie:," oh, you know what? this is nothing. my father is a raging alcoholic. "
10,2,charlie:," oh, i'm sorry, have i made this evening uncomfortable? "
10,2,ross:," fajitas! be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!"
10,2,rachel:," ross, you don't even have oven mitts on! "
10,2,ross:, that is gonna hurt tomorrow! 
10,2,phoebe:," no, of course we're not."
10,2,phoebe:, i know.
10,2,phoebe:," oh, i don't know, she's pretty tired, too, i think we've got her onboard."
10,2,phoebe:, huh.
10,2,phoebe:," oh, you'd be getting a really good one. i mean, you know, he's really funny. like, the other day he made up this joke."
10,2,phoebe:," what's green and says ""hey, i'm a frog""? a talking frog! oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny."
10,2,phoebe:," oh, no, no. not leslie. no, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet."
10,2,phoebe:," oh, no, no, you can't have chandler, no. no, no. she's my little genius. i got big hopes for her. she's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.."
10,2,phoebe:," oh, i think you're right. oh, wow. phoebe, i don't think i can give one of them up. i mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies."
10,2,phoebe:, how about tomorrow?
10,2,phoebe:, you'd do that for us?
10,2,phoebe:," look at them! aw. i love you so much. oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up! "
10,2,chandler:, where are bill and colleen?
10,2,monica:, they're in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you believe how nice they are?
10,2,chandler:, we have to leave!!
10,2,monica:, why? what did you do in the bathroom?
10,2,chandler:," i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may have told him."
10,2,monica:," oh my god, where's my purse? no, you know what? i can replace everything in there. get that binder, and let's go! "
10,2,colleen:, hey.
10,2,bill:," some little snacks for everybody. oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. those are for owen."
10,2,colleen:," i'll go get him in a second. by the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet."
10,2,chandler:, but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he already knows? 
10,2,owen:, i'm adopted?!
10,2,chandler:, see? intuitive!
10,2,bill:, what? where did you hear that?
10,2,owen:, he told me! and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
10,2,chandler:, which technically now you should give back!
10,2,colleen:, you told him he's adopted?
10,2,chandler:," i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa is real."""
10,2,owen:," we have to get out of here, baby! "
10,2,ross:, everyone? i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey.
10,2,rachel:, ooy.
10,2,ross:," and to love. ah, love. l o v e, love. l is for life. and what is life without love?"
10,2,rachel:," oh my god, are we supposed to answer?"
10,2,ross:," o is for ""oh, wow!"" the v is for this very surprising turn of events, which i'm still fine with by the way. e is for how extremely normal i find it. that you two are together. and now one day you might get married and have children of your own. "
10,2,joey:," dude, are you okay?"
10,2,ross:, totally.
10,2,rachel:," i'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan."
10,2,charlie:," wait, ross. ross. i i have to take off."
10,2,ross:, no!
10,2,charlie:," i'm sorry, i have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely."
10,2,ross:, wasn't it? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel.
10,2,charlie:," you're on fire! i'll call you in the morning, okay?"
10,2,ross:, okay.
10,2,charlie:, alright. 
10,2,charlie:," god, rachel, what ross just said that is just so.."
10,2,rachel:," oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."
10,2,charlie:, bye. 
10,2,ross:," okay, i guess it's just flan for three! hey, hey, that rhymed!"
10,2,rachel:," you know what, ross? i think we're gonna take off too."
10,2,ross:," oh, oh. of course. god, i'm so stupid. you guys are a couple now. i mean, you probably just want to be alone."
10,2,rachel:," no, no, it's just that it's getting late..."
10,2,ross:," hey, hey, it's fine. it's totally fine. we've got plenty of margaritas. it's all good. "
10,2,ross:, i don't even know what that's for. 
10,2,joey:, you know what? i think i'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
10,2,rachel:," yeah, that's probably a good idea."
10,2,joey:, yeah. i'll see you in the morning.
10,2,rachel:," uh huh. okay. you know what, joey, i don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this."
10,2,joey:," it doesn't look good, does it? "
10,2,joey:, morning. here you go.
10,2,ross:, thanks. did you stay here all night?
10,2,joey:, yeah.
10,2,ross:, so you took off my pants and shoes?
10,2,joey:," no, no, no. you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago soundtrack. look, ross, about, about rachel and i. listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? because nothing is gonna happen."
10,2,ross:, what do you mean?
10,2,joey:," well, she and i said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. and clearly.."
10,2,ross:," hey, what are you talking about? i'm fine!"
10,2,joey:," it's okay, ross, alright? i totally understand. of course you're not fine. you're.. you're ross and rachel."
10,2,ross:," except we're not. i mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. oh my god, is that right? has it been that long?"
10,2,joey:," that's what i hear, yeah."
10,2,ross:," this is crazy. i mean, six years? and because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? can i ask you something? really, what is this thing with you and rachel?"
10,2,joey:," come on, i mean, you know me, you know..."
10,2,ross:, joey.
10,2,joey:, i'm crazy about her.
10,2,ross:, and she feels the same way?
10,2,joey:, i think so.
10,2,ross:," well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on."
10,2,joey:," yeah, but, ross, i mean, you're not okay with it."
10,2,ross:," no, but i wanna be. hey, i will be. besides, i'm with charlie, right? oh my god, i'm still with charlie, aren't i? i mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?"
10,2,joey:," no, no, no, no, that was that was just for me. are you sure about this?"
10,2,ross:," yeah, i'm sure."
10,2,joey:, and we're okay? ending credits 
10,2,monica:," hey, phoebs"
10,2,phoebe:, hey.
10,2,monica:," uhm, we just wanna give you a heads up. bill and colleen hate us."
10,2,chandler:," owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him."
10,2,monica:, what?
10,2,phoebe:," still, he had to find out sometime."
10,2,chandler:," yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them? "
10,2,chandler:, i'm gonna go tell emma she was an accident. 
10,3,chandler:," so, you and rachel tonight, huh?"
10,3,joey:, yeah. it's actually our first official date 
10,3,chandler:, wow! so tonight may be the night! you're nervous?
10,3,joey:," naa, no. this is the part i'm actually good at."
10,3,chandler:, what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self loathing.
10,3,joey:, it's ok!
10,3,chandler:, how can you be so confident?
10,3,joey:," well, i... i know exactly what i'm gonna do!"
10,3,chandler:, really? like you have a routine?
10,3,joey:," no, no no no no. see. each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness."
10,3,chandler:, really?
10,3,joey:," no, i do six things! first, i look deep in her eyes. then, i kiss her. next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh."
10,3,chandler:, you mean like this? 
10,3,joey:," no! not like that, no no. no, like this. "
10,3,chandler:," oh, i see what you mean, that's quite nice. "
10,3,joey:, more foosball?
10,3,chandler:, ...and beer!! opening credits 
10,3,monica:, hey!

10,3,ross:," i'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?"
10,3,chandler:, she went on one of those spray on tan places.
10,3,ross:," eh, you got a spray on tan?"
10,3,monica:, chandler gets pedicures!
10,3,ross:," why, why you do, like with the the toe separators?"
10,3,chandler:, why...why?
10,3,ross:," still, i can't believe that's sprayed on... i mean, it looks really good. i wonder if i should get one!"
10,3,chandler:," sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."

10,3,joey:, nah! i don't have another level!!

10,3,rachel:," well, it wasn't just me, alright? he freaked out too! he couldn't even undo my bra!"
10,3,monica:," wow, really? one time he just looked at my bra and it popped open. "
10,3,rachel:," i do not know what's wrong with us, i mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! but this time it was leading somewhere and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me."
10,3,monica:," well, you guys have been friends forever. remember the first time that you kissed ross? how weird that was? you couldn't stop laughing? you got through that."
10,3,rachel:," ok, that's true. that's true, we can do this. you're right, you're right, we can do this. we're just gonna power through! "

10,3,amanda:," ooh, that accident must have been terrible. you look positively ghastly."
10,3,chandler:," well, aren't you a treat. "
10,3,monica:," i can't believe you tried to cut me out. why phoebe, why?"
10,3,phoebe:," it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill."
10,3,monica:, i'm still all those things!
10,3,phoebe:, you're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
10,3,monica:, i am scrappy.
10,3,phoebe:," exactly! look, no matter what i tried to do, i couldn't keep you out of my life. of all the people i have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in."
10,3,monica:, it's because i'm scrappy.
10,3,phoebe:," yeah, you are. and i'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because i don't know what i would do without you."
10,3,monica:, i won't know what i would do without you. 
10,3,monica:," well, i guess we should go back in. when you gave me another chance, i guess we should do the same for amanda."
10,3,phoebe:," yeah, i guess you're right. "
10,3,amanda:, can you believe it. i've never had any professional dance training. 
10,3,glenda:," now, let me explain how this works. you go into the booth, and..."
10,3,ross:," i'm gonna stop you right there, glenda. okay? does it look like this is my first time, huh? now i want 4 two's... and i want them all on my back."
10,3,glenda:, okay... 
10,3,ross:," wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it? "
10,3,ross:, which... which... which... which one is it? 
10,3,ross:, oh! son of a bitch! 
10,3,rachel:, what is the matter with us?
10,3,joey:," well, i know what's the matter with me."
10,3,rachel:," no, i mean with us, you know. i mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?"
10,3,joey:, i don't know. 
10,3,chandler:," that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... hey!"
10,3,rachel:," hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when you and monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?"
10,3,chandler:," kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..."
10,3,rachel:," no, no, no... no, i mean... se x u ally..."
10,3,joey:," yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?"
10,3,chandler:," actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... i can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time. "
10,3,chandler:," i can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... well, i'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy. "
10,3,rachel:," well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
10,3,joey:," yeah, yeah... absolutely. i mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
10,3,rachel:," right, totally."
10,3,joey:," yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it."
10,3,rachel:," yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex."
10,3,joey:, that's a... pla an. 
10,3,joey:, wow... i did not see this coming.
10,3,rachel:, i know.
10,3,joey:," i don't get it. i mean, i was so sure this was what i wanted. "
10,3,rachel:, hmmm... me too... 
10,3,rachel:, i wonder how monica and chandler could do it?
10,3,joey:, i guess they weren't as good friends as we are. 
10,3,rachel:, aah... i bet you're right. 
10,3,joey:, so...
10,3,rachel:, yeah.
10,3,joey:, i love ya.

10,3,chandler:," i know, i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. you have to let me in."
10,3,ross:, really? did you count mississipily? 
10,3,ross:," dude, you're not tanned."
10,3,chandler:," no, i just had to get a picture of this. "

10,4,rachel:," wait, you can't go away this weekend! it's emma's birthday!"
10,4,ross:, yeah!
10,4,rachel:, we're having a party.
10,4,monica:," well, can't you just have the party when we get back?"
10,4,ross:, no.
10,4,rachel:," no, that day... that won't be her real birthday!"
10,4,chandler:, gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
10,4,ross:," c'mon you guys, this is really important to us."
10,4,monica:," well, i'm sorry, but chandler and i could really use a weekend away. you know, to reconnect... emotionally."
10,4,chandler:, there's this thing i really want us to do. i read about it in maxim...
10,4,rachel:," well, can't you just go to vermont the next day?"
10,4,ross:," yeah, we want everyone to be there. as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister."
10,4,rachel:," and i mean, you know, you guys... this is a big deal. i mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!"
10,4,monica:," all right, we'll stay. we can just drive up after the party."
10,4,chandler:," fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party..."
10,4,monica:," believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that! opening credits "
10,4,rachel:," you know pheebs, when i was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all."
10,4,phoebe:," oooh, i love family traditions like that. when uhm... when ursula and i were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!"
10,4,ross:, hi!
10,4,ross:," hey, i brought the camera for emma's video."
10,4,rachel:," oh, good, good! we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18."
10,4,phoebe:," oh, cool!! wow, it's like a time capsule!"
10,4,ross:, yeah!
10,4,phoebe:," oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn't even been invented yet! with friends who right now are just like babies! and they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!"
10,4,ross:," that's the hope! so, is emma awake yet?"
10,4,rachel:," oh no, it's still nap time. but she'll be up soon."
10,4,ross:," ah, and where is joey?"
10,4,rachel:, i said it's still nap time. 
10,4,ross:," hey, there is uncle joey!"
10,4,joey:, hey!
10,4,ross:," hey, say something to emma on her 18th birthday!"
10,4,joey:," 18, uh? "
10,4,ross:," joey, no!"
10,4,joey:," what, what!? it's for her hot friends!"
10,4,ross:, when they see this you'll be 52!
10,4,joey:, and starting to think about settling down!
10,4,rachel:," hey joey, will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on?"
10,4,joey:, i'd love to! yeah! 
10,4,joey:, we were supposed to bring presents?
10,4,phoebe:, yeah! i wrote emma a song.
10,4,joey:," oh, yeah! how was i supposed to know?"
10,4,phoebe:," joey, it's a birthday party."
10,4,joey:," yeah, but for a one year old. what's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer. and he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""el moo""! yeah... that's a funny cup! "
10,4,monica:, hey!
10,4,chandler:, hey hey! where's the birthday girl?
10,4,rachel:," oh, she's still napping"
10,4,chandler:," oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening."
10,4,rachel:," look, i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? emma will never have a first birthday again."
10,4,monica:, all right... you're right. we're sorry. now let's wake up emma and get the fun time started!
10,4,rachel:," no really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up."
10,4,monica:, hi!
10,4,ross:, hey!
10,4,monica:, so glad you came!
10,4,jack:, i can't believe emma is already one!
10,4,judy:, i remember your first birthday! ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. he pulled on his testicles so hard! we had to take him to the emergency room!
10,4,ross:, there's something you didn't know about your dad!
10,4,joey:, hey mr. and mrs. geller! let me help you with that.
10,4,jack:, thank you!
10,4,joey:," oh man, this is great, uh? the three of us together again! you know what would be fun? if we gave this present to emma from all of us!"
10,4,jack:, which one are you? 
10,4,monica:, i can't believe emma is still asleep!
10,4,chandler:," i know, what are we gonna do?"
10,4,monica:, i've got a plan. i've got a plan. i'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. you're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
10,4,chandler:, i'm not going to vermont with this monica!
10,4,joey:," hey pheebs, you know what? i was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe i could do something for emma using my talents!"
10,4,phoebe:, so youre gonna... hit on her?
10,4,joey:," no, no, no! my talents as an actor!"
10,4,phoebe:, oh!
10,4,joey:," you know, i could like maybe... i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!"
10,4,phoebe:, or you could stick a fork in an apple!
10,4,joey:," hey, i think emma might like it!"
10,4,rachel:, oh! emma might like what?
10,4,joey:," um, my present!"
10,4,rachel:, what did you get her?
10,4,joey:, actually we prepared performances.
10,4,phoebe:, separate performances.
10,4,joey:, but equally real!
10,4,rachel:," well, this sounds like fun! well, you know what? actually? people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?"
10,4,phoebe:," sure, yeah!"
10,4,joey:, o k.
10,4,rachel:," all right, lets get this party started, huh? joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us."
10,4,ross:," oh, great!"
10,4,phoebe:, are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
10,4,joey:," hey, i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!"
10,4,rachel:," so, joey, what are you gonna do for us?"
10,4,joey:, i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emmas books.
10,4,rachel:," oh, ok, which one?"
10,4,joey:," uh, why, its a... one of her favorites, uh, riding the storm out. coping with post partum depression eesh! love you forever. love you forever. by robert munsch. published by firefly books. printed in mexico. a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang ill love you forever, ill like you for always, as long as i'm living, my baby youll be. . and while he rocked her, he sang ill love you forever, ill like you for always, as long as i'm living, my baby youll be."
10,4,rachel:, wow! that was amazing!
10,4,ross:, i was not ready for this today!
10,4,ross:, amazing... amazing.
10,4,rachel:," oh, phoebe, im sorry! phoebe has prepared something as well."
10,4,phoebe:," thats right, i've prepared a song for emma. from my heart to hers. for theres no greater gift, than the gift of music. emma! your name poses a dilemma. 'cause not much else rhymes with emma! maybe the actor richard crenna, he played the commanding officer in rambo. happy birthday emma!"
10,4,rachel:, is that it?
10,4,phoebe:," no, of course not! i also, you know, prepared a reading . sex and the single mother. finding your g spot."
10,4,everybody:," no, no, no, no, no! "
10,4,judy:, hello emma. happy eighteenth birthday.
10,4,jack:," right now that seems so far away, seventeen years."
10,4,judy:," yes, youll be all grown up by then. well be... well your grandfather and i might not be here."
10,4,jack:," thats true! this message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, emma!"
10,4,judy:," after all, my parents died very young."
10,4,jack:, and my cholesterols off the charts!
10,4,judy:," ok, cut! great. that was... that was just... yeah!"
10,4,rachel:," ross, um, dont forget to get a shot of emmas cake. its in a box in the fridge."
10,4,ross:, sure.
10,4,rachel:," oh, you're gonna love this cake. i got it from a bakery in new jersey, corinos."
10,4,monica:," oh my god, that place has the creamiest frosting! i use to hitchhike there when i was a kid."
10,4,rachel:," well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, theyll copy it in icing!"
10,4,monica:," oh, did you do a picture of emma?"
10,4,rachel:, yes! on a cake shaped like a bunny.
10,4,ross:," uh, rach? does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? say for bachelorette parties?"
10,4,rachel:, oh! now its a party!
10,4,rachel:, uh.. is it ok that i still think it looks delicious?
10,4,judy:," jack, look at this."
10,4,jack:," i know what you're thinking judy, the resemblance is uncanny!"
10,4,ross:," no, no, this is not what i ordered. ok? i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughters birthday and i need a bunny cake, right now!"
10,4,ross:," ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babys face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . that is a weird sentence!"
10,4,rachel:," oh! believe you me! i am going to bring this cake back, i don't even want it in my home... joey, don't touch it!!"
10,4,joey:, i'm so confused!
10,4,rachel:," yes, yes. i still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!"
10,4,chandler:, to be fair this one does have nuts. 
10,4,ross:," hey mon, that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake."
10,4,monica:," oh. so nice of her to pull my hair, 'till i dropped the key! "
10,4,ross:," well, you know what? while we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday, huh? ok!"
10,4,chandler:, hi emma! it's the year 2020. are you still enjoying your nap?
10,4,monica:," we're aunt monica and uncle chandler, by the way. you may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!"
10,4,chandler:," we used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. because of you! happy birthday. "
10,4,monica:," ross, rachel promised it would be over by now. we seriously have to go, if we want to get to vermont. i called them and the last train leaves in a half hour."
10,4,phoebe:," and you know, i have a massage client soon."
10,4,ross:," you guys, just please.. a little bit longer. i promise, rachel will be back with the cake any minute. monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?"
10,4,monica:," alright, 5 more minutes. "
10,4,ross:," hello? oh no! what happened? ok ok, where are you? . ok, i'll be right there. "
10,4,chandler:, was that emma? is she up? 
10,4,ross:," no, rachel got pulled over for speeding. she forgot her licence so now i have to bring it to her."
10,4,phoebe:," well, if you're leaving, i'm definitely gonna go."
10,4,monica:, no! wait! if anybody gets to go.. it's us we've been complaining the longest!
10,4,ross:," no, wait ! you guys, no, no, you can't leave! rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. how do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?"
10,4,chandler:, i don't know! you'll tell us on monday! 
10,4,ross:," joey! you're in charge, ok? you make sure nobody leaves! "
10,4,joey:, got it! hey hey hey! where do you think you're going? 
10,4,chandler:, to the bathroom!
10,4,joey:," alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... wait a minute, there is a window in there!"
10,4,phoebe:, oh no! he's not getting away that easy! 
10,4,chandler:, what are you doing? get the hell out of here! 
10,4,joey:," well, that one did not have emma's face on it."
10,4,phoebe:," no, it did not."
10,4,joey:, no.
10,4,judy:," well, we better get going, it's late. jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. he has trouble staying in his lane."
10,4,jack:, last winter i went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. the papers thought it was a hate crime.
10,4,judy:," anyway, it was lovely seeing you."
10,4,joey:, ok! 
10,4,judy:, bye... bye dear.
10,4,joey:, nighty night!
10,4,judy:, nighty night!
10,4,joey:," bye, bye."
10,4,phoebe:, joey? how could you just let them leave?
10,4,joey:," hey, hey, hey, hey! i'm not gonna mess with jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country."
10,4,monica:," no, he didn't! he pretended to be a quaker to get out of korea."
10,4,joey:, oh! well that's it! he's the last one to go. i'm locking you guys in. 
10,4,chandler:," you do know, i can just turn them the other way around, right?"
10,4,joey:, oh! i forgot you used to live here! 
10,4,joey:, hello?
10,4,estelle:, joey! it's estelle!
10,4,joey:, hey!

10,4,joey:, what audition?
10,4,estelle:, the one i told you about last week?
10,4,joey:, what? you never said anything about an audition!
10,4,estelle:, let me start over. i just got a call about an audition. i think you can still make it. it's down at the astor theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.
10,4,joey:, a monologue? i don't have.. i got it. aah! so... i'm gonna take off!
10,4,phoebe:," wh.. what? no wait, you don't get to leave! i've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!"
10,4,monica:," yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!"
10,4,phoebe:," well, oh, ok now... only one of us has to stay with emma. ok, and as the person who realized that, i get to go!"
10,4,monica:, no! no! let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
10,4,joey:," oh! i got it! ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. alright? whoever gets the highest number gets to go first."
10,4,monica:," ok, ten."
10,4,joey:," okay, monica picks ten, i call nine! anyone else?"
10,4,phoebe:," no, lets just draw straws."
10,4,joey:," or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the.."
10,4,chandler:, i'm begging you stop.
10,4,joey:, right.
10,4,monica:," we got wind up toys for emma for her birthday. we can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!"
10,4,phoebe:, yeah!! let's do that!
10,4,chandler:, that sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in vermont! 
10,4,monica:, everybody get your toys! 
10,4,phoebe:, ok! i want the dolphin!
10,4,chandler:, thats a bear.
10,4,phoebe:, i'm too excited!
10,4,monica:," phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, joey, you get the robot, and chandler and i get the dog. ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. now the one who comes in last, stays!"
10,4,joey:," ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! "

10,4,joey:, way to go robot!
10,4,phoebe:, good job alan!
10,4,joey:," hey, good race you guys."
10,4,phoebe:," yeah, see you later! "
10,4,monica:," no! no, no... wait! we didn't lose. the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically..."
10,4,chandler:, they left. 
10,4,rachel:," no, there isn't time to go to the bakery. we're just gonna come home... everybody left? alright, well just tell emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. bye... "
10,4,ross:, rachel!
10,4,rachel:, ooh! god! sorry!
10,4,ross:, i can't believe they gave you a ticket. you're such a good driver. 
10,4,rachel:, emma's awake.
10,4,ross:, yeah?
10,4,rachel:, i can't believe this. this is her first birthday. she's awake. we're not even there. everybody left. we still have this stupid obscene cake.
10,4,ross:," hey, maybe i can fix that, you know. try to turn it into something else. "
10,4,rachel:," oh, why do you even bother? i already ruined her first birthday... and do you know how important these early experiences are ross? very! according to the back cover of that book that you gave me."
10,4,ross:," rach, she's not going to remember this."
10,4,rachel:," i guess... oh, i just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing ""happy birthday"". then we would all go into... hey get out of the road you stupid student driver!!! they have to learn!"
10,4,ross:, hey!
10,4,rachel:, what?
10,4,ross:, it's not bad.
10,4,rachel:, oh my god! look what... you made it into a bunny. how did you do that?
10,4,ross:," well, i just made these two things uhm... cheeks. and then i split this to make ears."
10,4,rachel:," well, i'm very impressed."
10,4,ross:," some can sing, some can dance. i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures. "
10,4,monica:," now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size."
10,4,chandler:," i'm sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica?"
10,4,monica:, game?
10,4,chandler:," emma, you even know it's your birthday today? you're one! one year old, that's little. "
10,4,chandler:, ooh! that's my girl!
10,4,monica:, that's how old you are.
10,4,chandler:, did i teach her that? did i just... impart wisdom?
10,4,monica:," ooh, i want one..."
10,4,chandler:, me too... 
10,4,chandler:, there's no one around. why don't we just take this one?
10,4,monica:, ...and head to canada!

10,4,phoebe:," oh good, i didn't miss the party."
10,4,monica:, what about your massage client?
10,4,phoebe:," i just felt so bad, missing this. so i just slipped him a little something, you know. as long as i'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright. "
10,4,joey:," okay, if ross and rachel ask, i've been here the whole time. the whole time! "
10,4,joey:, i've been here the whole time!
10,4,ross:," joey, we just saw you come in. you ran past us on the stairs."

10,5,joey:," but uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? rach, please tell me were getting rid of her."
10,5,rachel:," joey, i cant do that!"
10,5,joey:," oh, come on! last night i was finishing off a pizza and she said ""uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"" i dont need that kind of talk in my house!"
10,5,rachel:," well joey, uhm look, i know that shes difficult, but i think its really good that shes here."
10,5,joey:, 'cause we will appreciate it more when shes gone?
10,5,rachel:," no, it's just... look, you know, when i first moved to the city i was a lot like her! i was spoiled, self centered and you guys really took care of me."
10,5,joey:," yeah, monica made us!"
10,5,rachel:," well, uhm... whatever, i have really appreciated it, 'cause i dont think i would be the person that i am today if it wasnt for you guys. see, i wanna help amy the way you guys helped me. and i know its gonna take patience, but thats ok."
10,5,amy:, good morning.
10,5,joey:, yeaah.
10,5,rachel:," amy, thats what i was supposed to wear today, thats why i hung it on the door."
10,5,amy:," oh, sweety, you cant pull this off."
10,5,rachel:," amy, you know what? i was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future."
10,5,amy:," oh, i cant, honey. im gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. i am not happy. oh... sure you wanna eat that?"
10,5,joey:," im curvy, and i like it!    "
10,5,phoebe:, hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever.
10,5,chandler:, i doubt that! tell her about us last year.
10,5,monica:," oh, well, i bought chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song."
10,5,ross:, seriously?
10,5,chandler:, word!
10,5,phoebe:," well, mine was worse than that."
10,5,rachel:," well, what happened?"
10,5,phoebe:," we were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing..."
10,5,rachel:," oh, that is so tacky."
10,5,phoebe:," well, thats what i said, but it turns out, mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!"
10,5,monica:," oh my god, mike was gonna propose?"
10,5,rachel:," phoebe, thats huge!"
10,5,ross:," well, do you wanna marry him?"
10,5,phoebe:," yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, i dont think hes ever gonna ask again! i mean, i said no in barbados and now this!"
10,5,chandler:, she's right! if i were a guy and... did i just say if i were a guy..?
10,5,monica:," maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!"
10,5,phoebe:," oh, i don't know, i don't know, isn't that a little desperate?"
10,5,monica:," i proposed to chandler! alright, moving on..."
10,5,chandler:," oh, i don't think it was desperate, i think it was amazing!"
10,5,monica:, thank you.
10,5,phoebe:," well, do you think i should propose?"
10,5,rachel:, i think it could be kind of great!
10,5,ross:, absolutely! you'll love the feeling! there's nothing like it!
10,5,phoebe:," ok, ok, so how should i do it?"
10,5,monica:," how about at a game, on the big screen?"
10,5,rachel:, uuuh!! how about at a footlocker? 
10,5,monica:," what? what? he obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!"
10,5,phoebe:," yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two like that?"
10,5,chandler:, sounds good to me... but what would a guy think? 
10,5,amy:, nana is on the phone 
10,5,rachel:," oh! that's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!"
10,5,amy:, she did? who got her condo in boca?
10,5,rachel:," hello? oh, it's our nanny! hi! oh... god! i hope you feel better! ok, bye! that's molly, she's sick. can you watch emma today?"
10,5,ross:," no, i can't. i have back to back classes. did molly say what she had? because my throat's been hurting?"
10,5,rachel:, menstrual cramps.
10,5,ross:, i don't think that's what this is.
10,5,rachel:, can any of you watch emma?
10,5,monica:," no, sorry sweety.."
10,5,phoebe:," no, i've got work and then i'm proposing.."
10,5,rachel:," great, shoot, what are we gonna do?"
10,5,amy:," well, i can do it."
10,5,rachel:," well, actually... "
10,5,ross:," well, can i talk to you for a sec.?"
10,5,rachel:, yeah.
10,5,ross:," um, i do not want her baby sitting our child."
10,5,rachel:, why not?
10,5,ross:," well, for one thing, she keeps calling her ella!"
10,5,rachel:," wha.. well, ella's a nice name!"
10,5,ross:," fine, we'll call the next one ella."
10,5,rachel:, wha... the next one?
10,5,ross:," okay, um... i don't want her watching our baby."
10,5,rachel:," ross, i am trying to help her become a better person. this is a huge breakthrough for her! she just offered to do something for another human being!!"
10,5,ross:, i... i don't know..
10,5,rachel:," ross, i'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? do you understand how important that is in our world? "
10,5,amy:," um... listen, i couldn't help but overhear... 'cause i was trying to... listen, let me do this alright? i really wanna help you guys out, and plus rachel's been so wonderful to me... "
10,5,rachel:, absolutely.
10,5,amy:, oh! great! so how much does it pay?    
10,5,chandler:, hey joe! how's the second draft of the letter coming?
10,5,joey:," great, i'm finished! in fact, i just dropped it off at the agency. "
10,5,monica:, you dropped it off?
10,5,joey:, yeah.
10,5,chandler:, can we read it? can you print out another copy?
10,5,joey:," no can do amigo. no, i didn't use the computer. felt more personal to hand write it. "
10,5,monica:, you hand wrote it?
10,5,joey:," yeah, and don't worry. i didn't try to sound smart at all! see ya later! "
10,5,monica:," oh my god, oh my god, that letter is gonna go in our file! we're never gonna get a kid. no, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!"
10,5,chandler:," it's ok, it's ok. you know what? i'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. "
10,5,monica:, okay good.
10,5,chandler:," hello, this is chandler bing. somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. uh huh... uh huh... okay... thank you. good bye. ."
10,5,monica:," ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? you know what? just tell me on the way to the bird store."
10,5,chandler:, they loved it.
10,5,monica:, what?
10,5,chandler:, they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
10,5,monica:, they thought joey was a child?
10,5,chandler:," she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings. "
10,5,amy:, hi!
10,5,monica:," hey, what did you guys do today?"
10,5,amy:," ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi."
10,5,chandler:, that sounds like fun.
10,5,amy:," yeah, not really. babies are dull. "
10,5,rachel:," hey! hi, how's my girl?"
10,5,amy:," i'm fine! and, i got you a present for letting me stay with you. ready?"

10,5,rachel:, you pierced her ears? how could you do this without telling me? 
10,5,amy:," well, if i had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?"
10,5,chandler:, i think she looks cute. ... but i am wrong!
10,5,rachel:," oh my god, oh my god, here comes ross. he's gonna flip out."
10,5,amy:," why, did something happen to his falafel cart?"
10,5,rachel:, ugh. 
10,5,ross:, hi ross.
10,5,ross:," hey emma. oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? she can barely see. ."
10,5,rachel:," nah, i don't really want her to see. "
10,5,ross:, why not?
10,5,monica:, because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
10,5,chandler:, like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
10,5,ross:, come here oh! there she is! hi! 
10,5,ross:, what?
10,5,rachel:, nothing.

10,5,rachel:," i know, i know, and you were right ross. you are soo irresponsible i am never letting you baby sit ever again!"
10,5,amy:," hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? she needs to have a cool fun aunt!"

10,5,amy:, o okay!
10,5,chandler:, hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
10,5,rachel:, i can't believe this. all i wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
10,5,amy:," well, i don't need you to help me, because i already know what i'm going to do with my life."
10,5,rachel:, oh yeah? since when?
10,5,amy:, since today... i am going to be a baby stylist.
10,5,rachel:, what?
10,5,ross:, that's not a thing!
10,5,amy:," well, it should be. i'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming..."
10,5,rachel:, babies don't care if they're slim.
10,5,amy:, enter amy!

10,5,announcer:, get a load of this... she's proposing to him. guess we know who wears the pants in that family. 
10,5,phoebe:, that's not very enlightened!

10,5,amy:," yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!"
10,5,rachel:, i can't believe i ever even tried to help you. you are so beyond help.
10,5,amy:," you know what? ever since i got here, you have been nothing but negative."
10,5,rachel:, excuse me?
10,5,amy:," you didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. then, i tried to help your daughter to de emphasize her flaws and suddenly i am the bad guy?"
10,5,rachel:," joey, where are those bags?"
10,5,joey:, she has a lot of crap!
10,5,amy:," this is gonna be so great. just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid jill... oh! who has gotten fat by the way..."
10,5,rachel:, seriously?

10,5,amy:, you can?
10,5,rachel:," yeah. i just, i kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are."
10,5,amy:," thank you. i've got to admit, emma does look cute."
10,5,rachel:, did you just say emma?
10,5,amy:," ugh, i'm sorry... ella.  "
10,5,phoebe:," that woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. mike, obviously you have balls."
10,5,mike:," but please, let's just forget the whole thing."
10,5,phoebe:," i would love it. consider it forgotten... but just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, i promise i'll say yes. whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake. "
10,5,phoebe:," it's in the cake, isn't it?"
10,5,mike:, where else would lame mr. no balls hide it? 
10,5,phoebe:," what's the matter with me? how do i keep ruining this? i'm sorry, i'm sorry!"
10,5,mike:, no! it's my fault. i keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all i wanna do is tell you that i love you and i want to spend the rest of my life with you. 
10,5,mike:, i'm gonna do this now.
10,5,phoebe:, oh my god!

10,6,joey:," that's great! hey, can you cast me in it?"
10,6,chandler:," oh... i don't know, i really don't think you're right for the part."
10,6,joey:," what do you mean? i can do anything, i'm a chameleon! huh? i'm old! i'm tired! hey, i'm hot i'm cold!! huh?? come on! what can't i do?"
10,6,chandler:," first of all. bravo. uh, but i really don't think you're right for this. the part calls for a stuffy college professor."
10,6,joey:," i can do that! ""hello, i'm your professor. when i'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. i like to use..."" oh, what's the product?"
10,6,chandler:, software that facilitates inter business networking e solutions?

10,6,ross:," oh, i'm so excited, i mean, apparently i beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys i went to graduate school with. not that i'm keeping score or anything... five!"
10,6,charlie:," wow, that's great! so, tell me about the grant!"
10,6,ross:," well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. and if i get it, i'll finally be able to complete my field research! and there will be an article about me in the ""paleontology review""! yeah! that'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!"
10,6,charlie:, wait. are you talking about the dewar grant?
10,6,ross:, yeah. why?
10,6,charlie:, benjamin hobart is administering that grant.
10,6,ross:, your ex boyfriend?
10,6,charlie:, yeah.
10,6,ross:," so, your ex boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!"
10,6,charlie:," no, no, we ended up in great terms. i mean, if anything, i think this could help you. you know what? why don't we all go out to dinner together, and i can introduce you."
10,6,ross:," well, if you think it would help."
10,6,charlie:," yes, absolutely. i'll call him."
10,6,ross:," ok, now, is there anything i can do to... you know, butter him up? anything he really likes?"

10,6,phoebe:, yeah. 
10,6,monica:," oh, well. now that i'm here i might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! just happen to have my label maker!"
10,6,phoebe:," oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! did you and chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?"
10,6,monica:," uh, chandler did! what does he want you to give up?"
10,6,phoebe:, a bunch of stuff. and the worst one... he wants me to get rid of gladys.
10,6,monica:, who's gladys? oh! what a tragic loss!
10,6,phoebe:," yeah. i really hate to give her up. oh, i know!! oh, you should take her!"
10,6,monica:," well, i i i i... i don't know..."
10,6,phoebe:," why, you don't like her?"
10,6,monica:," well, of course i do. what's not to like! i'll take her in a minute! but, you know, i think that you're giving up too easy, honey. i think that you need to fight for her!"
10,6,phoebe:, really? you think?
10,6,monica:," absolutely! yes, you say to him ""i'm sorry mike i can't live without her, she means too much to me!"""
10,6,phoebe:," ok, i'll fight for her. ok! oh, wait, oh i just realized... if i do that, that means you don't get her."
10,6,monica:," damn it, i did not think this through!   "
10,6,chandler:, hey you guys. 
10,6,rachel:, hi!
10,6,joey:, oh! any word on casting yet?
10,6,chandler:," joe, i told you, you're just not right for the part."
10,6,joey:," what do you mean? rach, don't i seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e crap from?"
10,6,rachel:," look, c'mon, please? it's not like i'm asking for some crazy favour. this is what i do for a living. i am a professional actor! oh, man, i'm two hours late for work! . look, here's a copy of my reels. it's got all the commercials that i've been in."
10,6,chandler:, joe...

10,6,chandler:, fine!
10,6,joey:, thank you. 
10,6,chandler:," work, joe!"
10,6,joey:, what am i gonna do now?
10,6,joey:, just pass it to your boss!
10,6,chandler:," he's not right for the part. so if i suggest him, my bosses are gonna think i'm an idiot! and that's something they should learn on their own!"
10,6,rachel:," just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys."
10,6,chandler:," that's good! i liked it, they didn't. joey, for god's sake, go to work! .  "
10,6,ross:, i can't believe i'm about to meet benjamin hobart. i've always thought of him as one of the people i'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. do you think there's any chance he'll bring christie brinkley or c3po?
10,6,charlie:," sorry, looks like it's just him."
10,6,benjamin:," charlie! my god, you look absolutely stunning!"
10,6,ross:," well, i... i am having a good hair day."

10,6,benjamin:," oh, well, likewise. actually, not likewise. i've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice! "
10,6,charlie:, shall we? .
10,6,benjamin:, thank you! . i can't believe that you chose this restaurant! do you remember the night?
10,6,charlie:, you weren't there!
10,6,ross:," no, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz zzz, mmm."
10,6,charlie:," ross, why don't you tell benji about your proposal, while i go to the ladies room?"
10,6,benjamin:," so, tell me about it."
10,6,ross:," ok well, i would like to do a dig in the painted desert."
10,6,benjamin:, m m.
10,6,ross:," see, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated."
10,6,benjamin:, break up with charlie!
10,6,ross:, what?
10,6,benjamin:, what?
10,6,ross:," did you just say ""break up with charlie""?"
10,6,benjamin:," well, yes, and now. yes i did say it, and no, i didn't not say it."
10,6,ross:," kind of inappropriate, don't you think?"
10,6,benjamin:," i'm sorry. i just haven't seen her for so long! all these feelings are rushing back! i'm starting to realize how much i missed her, and i'm gonna need you to break up with her."
10,6,ross:, are you serious?
10,6,benjamin:," if you say yes then i'm serious, if you say no then i'm joking!"
10,6,ross:, no!
10,6,benjamin:, joking it is!  
10,6,phoebe:," hi! sorry, i'm late."
10,6,monica:," hey, how did it go with mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?"
10,6,phoebe:," no, he really hates it. but he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! so you got to pick your battles. but the good news is, gladys is yours!"
10,6,monica:," wow, what's the bad news!"
10,6,rachel:, who's gladys?
10,6,phoebe:," oh, she's that work of art i made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame."
10,6,rachel:," oh, and monica gets to keep her? in her house? i am so jealous!"
10,6,phoebe:," oh, i didn't know you wanted her too!"
10,6,monica:, huh!
10,6,rachel:," well, i mean, sure, of course. but... you already gave that to monica, so..."
10,6,monica:," you know, i would give her up, for you."
10,6,rachel:," no, i couldn't let you do that."
10,6,monica:, but i want to.
10,6,rachel:, but i don't want you to.
10,6,monica:, but i insist!
10,6,rachel:, but i insist harder!
10,6,phoebe:," girls, girls, stop, ok? we'll flip a coin. heads, she's rachel's, tails she's monica's. . tails! monica, she's yours!"
10,6,monica:," no, that landed in your food!"
10,6,rachel:," no, no, that's ok. you won fair and square. i'm so sad!  "
10,6,chandler:, hey joe!
10,6,joey:, what's up?
10,6,chandler:, bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
10,6,joey:, oh.
10,6,chandler:, i'm sorry man.
10,6,joey:," but, ehm... you watched the tape?"
10,6,chandler:," yeah! i... i... i liked it! but, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. stupid sons of bitches!"
10,6,joey:, you didn't watch the tape.
10,6,chandler:, what!? of course i did!
10,6,joey:," look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
10,6,chandler:," i'm not lying to you, i watched it!"
10,6,joey:," well, you lied again! "
10,6,chandler:, i watched it!
10,6,joey:, keep going pinocchio!
10,6,chandler:, i did!
10,6,joey:, no you didn't! 
10,6,chandler:," i'm telling you, i watched the tape. "
10,6,rachel:, did you watch the tape?
10,6,chandler:, interview room. ross and two other professors are sitting on one side of a long desk. benjamin hobart is sitting on the other side]  
10,6,benjamin:," well, i believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. i plan to begin there."
10,6,benjamin:, interesting.
10,6,ross:, i guess!
10,6,benjamin:, primarily in the pierre shale region of south dakota.
10,6,benjamin:," certainly. very well. and dr. geller, when is my birthday?"
10,6,ross:, what? i... i... 
10,6,benjamin:, care to venture a guess?
10,6,ross:, may 12th?
10,6,benjamin:, half a dozen.
10,6,benjamin:, three for excavation and two for analysis.
10,6,benjamin:," certainly. dr. geller, which 1965 shirelles hit was later covered by a popular british invasion band?"
10,6,ross:, wha..? i need 6 graduate students. 
10,6,benjamin:," no! i'm sorry, we were looking for ""baby it's you"". baby it's you."
10,6,ross:," wha...? wait, wait, wait, just a minute. none of my questions have anything to do with paleontology."
10,6,benjamin:," you're right, i apologize. scratch the last question. spell ""boscodictiasaur""."
10,6,ross:," um... i've never heard of a ""boscodictiasaur""."
10,6,benjamin:," yeah, i just made it up. spell it."
10,6,ross:, ok. b o s ...
10,6,benjamin:," no, it starts with a silent ""m""."
10,6,ross:, oh come on!!  
10,6,chandler:, i can't believe joey. i hate being called a liar!
10,6,rachel:, but you are a liar.
10,6,chandler:, what did i just say? 
10,6,joey:, you still here?
10,6,chandler:," yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am insulted. when i tell somebody i did something..."
10,6,joey:," ok whoah hey... let me just stop you right there, ok? first, you lied, right? then, you lied about lying, ok? then you lied about lying about lying, ok? so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... stop lying!"
10,6,chandler:, why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape?
10,6,joey:, you wanna know wh...? you wanna know why? 
10,6,rachel:," well, this is going well. "
10,6,joey:," here's how i know you didn't watch the tape, ok? if you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. alright, now remember, i got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in japan. "
10,6,joey:, and that's how i know you didn't watch the tape! . 
10,6,chandler:, he really is a chameleon.  
10,6,phoebe:," well, gladys say hello to your new home! "
10,6,monica:," oh, my! "
10,6,rachel:," wow! oh, she's so nice and big! oh, monica, where are you going to display gladys oh so proudly? "
10,6,monica:, i haven't really settled on a spot yet!
10,6,rachel:," well, hey! how about right above the tv? . that way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!"
10,6,phoebe:," yeah, yeah! and you can get rid of that french poster."
10,6,monica:, i like that poster!
10,6,phoebe:, really? it doesn't have anything coming out of it. or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
10,6,rachel:, oh! there's nothing above your bed!!
10,6,monica:, are you still here? 
10,6,ross:," oh hi! hello! uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? aunt margaret's pants size?"
10,6,benjamin:, i've come here to apologize. i think i may have let my feelings for charlie interfere with the interview process. 
10,6,ross:, no! stop! 
10,6,benjamin:," anyway, i've decided to offer you the grant. "
10,6,ross:, really?
10,6,benjamin:, well... there is just one small... stipulation...
10,6,ross:, i have to break up with charlie?
10,6,benjamin:," hey, you got one right! "
10,6,ross:, you're crazy.
10,6,benjamin:," crazy, or... romantic?"
10,6,ross:, crazy!
10,6,benjamin:, ooor...
10,6,ross:, get out! 
10,6,rachel:, o oh my god!
10,6,joey:, what?
10,6,rachel:," joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?"
10,6,joey:, i got it from monica. she sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
10,6,rachel:," joey, we're not keeping this!"
10,6,joey:, but it's an original buffay...
10,6,rachel:," alright, fine. you can keep it. as long as you don't mind that she's haunted. "
10,6,joey:, hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
10,6,rachel:," well, legend has it joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep. "
10,6,rachel:," she climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half a body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. and then with her one good hand, she slo o owly re e a aches up and turns your doorknob."
10,6,joey:, get that legless witch out of here! 
10,6,monica:, hey! i sold that to joey.
10,6,rachel:," well, why i told him it's haunted. two can play at this game. "
10,6,monica:," no, too late. you can't give it back! "
10,6,rachel:, yes i can! 
10,6,monica:, no you can't. she's yours!
10,6,rachel:, she's yours!
10,6,monica:, she's yours!
10,6,rachel:, she's yours! 
10,6,phoebe:, hey! 
10,6,rachel:, she's mine!
10,6,monica:, she's m i i ne!
10,6,rachel:, she's mine!
10,6,monica:, she's mine!
10,6,phoebe:, you guys! you guys! you don't have to fight over her anymore. whoever doesn't get gladys gets glynnis. 
10,6,rachel:, i want gladys!
10,6,monica:, she's mine!
10,6,rachel:, she's mine!
10,6,monica:, she's mine!
10,6,rachel:, she's mine! 
10,6,chandler:," look, i'm sorry i didn't give them your tape. and i promise, next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not."
10,6,joey:, that's not the point chandler. the point is that you lied.
10,6,chandler:, i know. you're right. what's it gonna take for you to forgive me? 
10,6,monica:, oh my god! 
10,6,rachel:, excellent!
10,6,joey:," now, what do you say?"
10,6,chandler:, lying is wrong!
10,6,joey:, and?... and?
10,6,chandler:, i'm a pretty little girl.
10,6,phoebe:, i knew it! 
10,6,ross:, your ex boyfriend is insane.
10,6,charlie:, did you get the grant?
10,6,ross:," no i didn't, and you want to know why? because your ex boyfriend is still in love with you."
10,6,charlie:, what?
10,6,ross:," yeah. he wouldn't give me the grant, because i wouldn't give you up."
10,6,charlie:," benji isn't in love with me. i mean, he broke up with me. and besides, he's a very ethical man."
10,6,ross:," really? is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""underdog""?"
10,6,charlie:," i'm sure he was just joking, ross."
10,6,ross:," if you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? i'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question."
10,6,charlie:, seriously?
10,6,ross:," oh, i'm sorry, no. he did ask me one. uhm... how do you spell mboscodictiosaur?"
10,6,charlie:," well, if it's like the lake mbosco in congo, then m b o... "
10,6,ross:, damnit! 
10,6,benjamin:, dr. geller...? charlie... what are you... what are you doing here?
10,6,ross:," i want you to tell her everything. about the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... wally cox! that's the voice of underdog!"
10,6,benjamin:," like i tried to tell you in the interview ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia."
10,6,ross:," no, no, no. don't do that! i want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth."
10,6,charlie:, benji?
10,6,benjamin:," alright, it's true. i behaved horribly. but it's only because i still love you. and i would do anything to have you back in my life."
10,6,ross:," too little, too late, benji!"
10,6,charlie:, i can't believe this.
10,6,benjamin:," i never should have broken up with you. i think about you all the time. i mean, do you ever still think about me? "
10,6,ross:, no!
10,6,charlie:, yes!
10,6,ross:, what?
10,6,charlie:," i don't know what to say, benji. this is all so.... romantic."
10,6,ross:, or...
10,6,benjamin:," listen, i know, i may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?"
10,6,charlie:, maybe...
10,6,ross:," sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable."
10,6,charlie:," oh god! i am so sorry, but... i mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know..."
10,6,benjamin:, i'm sorry too... 
10,6,benjamin:, i love you!
10,6,charlie:, i love you too! 
10,6,ross:," okay, that's it. we are seeing other people! commercial break "
10,6,joey:, gladys? 
10,6,rachel:," ha ha ha, third time this week. man, this does not get old."
10,6,joey:, you're mean!
10,6,rachel:," oh, don't be such a baby! end"
10,7,ross:, hey you guys!
10,7,phoebe:, hey!
10,7,ross:," hey, what are you doing?"
10,7,mike:," oh, figuring out our wedding plans."
10,7,chandler:," that's funny, we were doing the same thing!"
10,7,ross:, yeah!
10,7,phoebe:," it's really crazy! the hall, the dress, the food... i i had no idea how expensive this stuff was!"
10,7,chandler:," yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the numbers."
10,7,phoebe:, so what did you two do about it?
10,7,chandler:," it was pretty simple actually, i came up with a couple of cost cutting solutions, wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell."
10,7,ross:," there's no way around it pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money."
10,7,mike:, i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
10,7,ross:," yeah, and i'm responsible for just like half of that."
10,7,phoebe:," but really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?"
10,7,mike:, are you serious?
10,7,phoebe:," yeah! now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall?"
10,7,mike:, i think it would make me wanna marry you even more. 
10,7,ross:," i've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!"
10,7,chandler:, maybe you do that next time you get married!
10,7,ross:," no, no, no. the next time it's gonna be a hawaii at sunset. "
10,7,joey:, hey!
10,7,chandler:, hey!
10,7,joey:, what's going on?
10,7,chandler:, our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
10,7,monica:, we?
10,7,chandler:, you know you don't want me to help. you can't have it both ways!
10,7,joey:," hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?"
10,7,chandler:, kind of. she's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
10,7,monica:," and it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state."
10,7,joey:," hey, maybe i should stop by! she could be a soap opera fan! it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity."
10,7,chandler:, little people?
10,7,joey:, celebrity.
10,7,monica:," ok, so i think i'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?"
10,7,chandler:, what...? no!
10,7,monica:, chandler?
10,7,chandler:," i don't, and i'm offended by the insinuation!"
10,7,monica:," ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the vcr?"
10,7,chandler:," i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine."
10,7,monica:, it isn't mine!
10,7,joey:, may i help you? 
10,7,phoebe:," well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated."
10,7,phoebe:," well, this is very generous!"
10,7,phoebe:, and we don't want any recognition. this is completely anonymous.
10,7,mike:, completely anonymous. from two kind strangers.
10,7,phoebe:," well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter."
10,7,mike:, not necessary.
10,7,phoebe:, buffay is spelled b u f f a y.
10,7,mike:, thank you both very much.
10,7,phoebe:," sure, i so glad we did this. it feels so good!"
10,7,mike:, it does. it feels really good!
10,7,phoebe:," oh, actually, that's the shirt i wore to the gym."
10,7,phoebe:, mhm... it's moist.   
10,7,ross:, hi!
10,7,rachel:, hi! emma will be up in a minute!
10,7,ross:," oh, good!"
10,7,rachel:," oh hey ross... listen, i heard about you and charlie. i'm really sorry."
10,7,ross:," oh, that's ok. i'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there."
10,7,rachel:, absolutely.
10,7,ross:, there was one! she's it! all the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
10,7,rachel:," so, uhm... what are you gonna do today?"
10,7,ross:," well, i was thinking of taking emma to the playground!"
10,7,rachel:," oh my god, what!?"
10,7,ross:, like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire!
10,7,rachel:," ok, look, ross. i do not want emma going to the playground."
10,7,ross:, be caaauuuse...
10,7,rachel:," all right, well, if you must know... i had a traumatic... swing incident... when i was little."
10,7,ross:, seriously?
10,7,rachel:," yes, i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. and to get me out my mom had to had to cut a big chunk of my hair! and it was uneven for weeks!"
10,7,ross:, and you made it through that? i wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
10,7,rachel:," ok, fine! you can make fun of me. i do not want emma going there. and i was thinking claire danes."
10,7,ross:," look, i'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? but the swings are perfectly safe, and besides emma loves them. you know what, you should come with us and you'll see!"
10,7,rachel:," ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! ok? when you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!"
10,7,ross:," space is filled with orbiting children. look, please, just come on, you know, when youll see the look on emmas face, i swear you wont regret it."
10,7,rachel:, all right!
10,7,ross:," good, you dont want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?"
10,7,rachel:," irrational, huh? all right, well, ill remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!"
10,7,ross:," oh, yeah, thats the same, i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings! "
10,7,monica:," oh my god, the adoption lady is early!"
10,7,chandler:," ok, ok, here we go."
10,7,monica:, ok.
10,7,chandler:, here we go. stand up straight. big smile. 
10,7,phoebe:," hello, is this the creepy residence?"
10,7,monica:," were waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, im glad youre here. i was cleaning this morning and i found this . i dont know if you wanna use it, but¦"
10,7,phoebe:," awe, this is so sweet of you! but you know what? i wont be needing a veil, i actually wont be wearing a dress at all!"
10,7,monica:, i told you! i am not coming to a naked wedding! 
10,7,phoebe:," no, no, no, were not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity."
10,7,monica:, thats crazy! . i am sorry. i just cant imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
10,7,phoebe:," we, you know, were different! we dont care about having a huge party. this is really nice for you, but, oh, please, i put this on? and, ow, i look , why, well, radiant. all right, well, who cares, i dont need a pretty veil and a fancy dress."
10,7,monica:," thats right. youre making a commitment and thats the same, whether you do that at the plaza or, where are you gonna do it?"
10,7,phoebe:, city hall.
10,7,monica:," ow! oh, that sounds nice! i am just there for jury duty. they really spruce that place up!"
10,7,phoebe:," its ok, its ok. i made my decision. what i really want is a great big wedding "
10,7,monica:, yay!
10,7,chandler:, but you already gave all your money to charity!
10,7,phoebe:," well, ill just ask for it back!"
10,7,chandler:, i dont think you can do that!
10,7,monica:," why not! this is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!"
10,7,chandler:," thats sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady. "
10,7,rachel:," ok, careful."
10,7,ross:, ok.
10,7,rachel:," careful, watch her hair. watch her hair!"
10,7,ross:," rach, shes got like three hairs!"
10,7,rachel:," i know but theyre just so beautiful! oh, my god, i just pulled one out."
10,7,ross:, i promise you shes safe! no watch how much she loves this. 
10,7,rachel:, ready sweety?
10,7,rachel:, ok.
10,7,ross:, here we go! 
10,7,rachel:," ok, careful, ok. oh, shes smiling! oh my god, she does like it!"
10,7,ross:," see, i told you!"
10,7,rachel:," awe! oh my god! looks, shes a little dare devil! oh, let me push, can i push?"
10,7,ross:," oh, absolutely!"
10,7,rachel:," ok. oh god. get the camera, its in the diaper bag."
10,7,ross:," ok! see? scared of swings, i bet you feel pretty silly ow!   "
10,7,mike:, were seriously asking for our money back?
10,7,phoebe:," oh my god, i love your shirt!"
10,7,phoebe:, excuse me?
10,7,phoebe:, so youre asking us to refund your donation to the children?
10,7,mike:, yeah! this feels really good.
10,7,phoebe:," hey, its not my business, besides its probably a good thing. we really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing¦"
10,7,phoebe:," hey, thats not fair! a persons wedding is important! and especially to me! ok? i didnt have a graduation party! and i didnt go to prom. and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to kill me or whatever. so i deserve a real celebration and i am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it. "
10,7,mike:, she could have been talking about either one of us.   
10,7,laura:," hi, i am laura, i am here for your adoption interview."
10,7,monica:," hi, i am monica and this is chandler. please come in."
10,7,laura:, thank you!
10,7,monica:, would you like something to drink?
10,7,laura:," oh, water would be fine."
10,7,monica:, ok. great. i am so glad that you are here. were really excited about getting this process started.
10,7,chandler:," oh, because we love kids. love em to death.well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law."
10,7,laura:, your place is just lovely.
10,7,monica:," ah, thank you. this building does have a wholesome family feel to it."
10,7,laura:," you know, i... i feel like i've been here before. are any other couples in the building adopting?"
10,7,monica:, is that that couple on the first floor? because we should get a baby before them. yeah! that guy tried to sell me drugs. 
10,7,chandler:," but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building."
10,7,laura:, oh...
10,7,chandler:, what?
10,7,laura:, i just realized why i remember this place.

10,7,ross:," no wait, okay, okay, i have an idea. i want you to get on the swing, okay? and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. "

10,7,phoebe:, oh! it ended okay. one of my friends shot him. 
10,7,mike:," well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. i mean, you really deserve that."
10,7,phoebe:," yeah, i really do. you know, i had nothing growing up. just like the kids i took the money from."
10,7,mike:," no! no, no. i see where this is going. don't make me go back there."
10,7,phoebe:," look, i can't have a wedding with this money now. it's tainted."
10,7,mike:," alright, fine. we'll give the money back."
10,7,phoebe:," monica and chandler's. they are preparing to show laura around. laura is standing with her back to the window, chandler and monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other."
10,7,laura:," well, i must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in."
10,7,monica:," oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!"
10,7,laura:," oh! well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure i have everything i need up to here... "
10,7,monica:, why don't i show you the baby's room? 
10,7,chandler:, what the hell are you doing?
10,7,joey:," well, you wouldn't let me in, so i thought you were in trouble."
10,7,chandler:," well, we're not."
10,7,joey:, but you called me 'bert'!? that's our code word for danger!
10,7,chandler:, we don't have a code word.
10,7,joey:," we don't? we really should. from now on, 'bert' will be our code word for danger. "
10,7,monica:, so that was the baby's room. 
10,7,monica:, what room should we see next?
10,7,chandler:, any room that isn't behind this couch! 
10,7,monica:," some people don't get him, but i think he's really funny! . "
10,7,joey:, i did not care for that!
10,7,chandler:," you have to get out of here. you slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you."
10,7,joey:," ok, ok! "
10,7,chandler:, ok! 
10,7,chandler:, what?
10,7,joey:, i forgot my bat. 
10,7,laura:, oh my god!

10,7,laura:, excuse me?
10,7,joey:," oh... yeah... probably you don't even remember my name. it's joey, by the way. and don't bother telling me yours, because i totally remember it... lady. yeah! i waited weeks for you to call me."
10,7,laura:," i gave you my number, you never called me."
10,7,joey:," no, no! don't try to turn this around on me, ok? i'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do."
10,7,laura:," well, i'm pretty sure i gave you my number."
10,7,joey:," really? think about it. come on! you're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? if i had your number, why wouldn't i call you?"
10,7,laura:," i don't know... well, maybe i'm wrong... i'm sorry..."
10,7,joey:," no, no, hey, no! too late for apologies... ok? you broke my heart. you know how many women i had to sleep with to get over you? "
10,7,laura:," joey, wait!"
10,7,joey:," no! i waited a long time, i can't wait anymore... "
10,7,laura:, i'm sorry that you had to see that. i'm so embarrassed...
10,7,chandler:," oh, that's really ok."
10,7,monica:," yeah, that we totally understand. dating is hard."
10,7,laura:," boy, you people are nice... and i've got to say... i think you're going to make excellent parents. "
10,7,joey:, laura!   
10,7,phoebe:," are you here to take more money? because, i think what you're looking for is an atm."
10,7,mike:," no, no, we're here to give the money back."
10,7,phoebe:," yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children. "
10,7,phoebe:," if i haven't said so already sir, congratulations!"
10,7,mike:, you know what? it's not your decision anymore.
10,7,mike:," on behalf of the children of new york, i reject your money."
10,7,phoebe:, yeah... and i'm giving it back to you... come on! consider it a contribution. 
10,7,phoebe:," please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together."
10,7,mike:," absolutely! and when you do, make sure you ask for brian."
10,7,phoebe:, no!   
10,7,monica:," hello...? oh hi... oh my god...! really...? i can't wait to tell chandler... ok, goodbye. "
10,7,chandler:, wrong number?
10,7,monica:, it was laura... she gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
10,7,chandler:, that's great!
10,7,monica:, now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. oh... 
10,7,chandler:, hello...? have you seen joey's bat? commercial break 
10,7,rachel:," ok... i got a spider. there were two, i picked the bigger one."

10,7,ross:," there you go! good for you! and you know what, i'm actually getting used to this little guy. i don't really even feel him in here anymore."
10,7,rachel:, that's because he's on your neck.
10,7,ross:, well... whaa... aaah... aaahhh... 
10,7,rachel:, ross! 
10,8,monica:, hey guys!
10,8,rachel:, hi! 
10,8,phoebe:, hey!
10,8,monica:, we need to talk to you about something.
10,8,chandler:, yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year.
10,8,all:, what?
10,8,phoebe:, hey!
10,8,ross:, are you kidding?
10,8,chandler:," well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. "
10,8,ross:, that doesn't sound like you... that's monica talking!
10,8,chandler:," no, no! we made this decision together. "
10,8,ross:, she's putting words in your mouth!
10,8,joey:," don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!"
10,8,rachel:, i can't believe this! this is emma's first thanksgiving!
10,8,monica:," no, it's not!"
10,8,rachel:, it's not? when was she born?
10,8,phoebe:," well, personally i think it's great you're giving yourself a break."
10,8,monica:," thank you, pheebs!"
10,8,phoebe:," sure. it's just as well... i mean, last year wasn't very good. i think she's losing her touch."
10,8,monica:," what? you are way off, lady!"
10,8,phoebe:," am i? really? am i? well, why don't you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. you'd be in competition... with yourself."
10,8,monica:," that's my favourite kind! okay, we are doing this!"
10,8,chandler:, don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
10,8,monica:," hey, stay out of this, chandler! this is between me... and me!"
10,8,chandler:, we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you? opening credits   
10,8,phoebe:, hey!
10,8,rachel:, hi! happy thanksgiving!
10,8,phoebe:," oh, yeah, happy needless turkey murder day."
10,8,monica:," you guys, i ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on bleecker. could you pick them up for me?"
10,8,phoebe:, you're not making the pies yourself?
10,8,monica:," no, no, no, i don't make chocolate pies. when i was younger i i enter in this pie eating contest. i ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick."
10,8,rachel:, did you at least win the contest?
10,8,monica:," 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! okay, i see you guys at 4."
10,8,rachel:, can't wait!

10,8,phoebe:," well, i wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant."
10,8,rachel:, oh my god! that's the creepiest thing i've ever heard!
10,8,phoebe:," okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she's a real dog!"
10,8,rachel:," oh! phoebe, all babies are beautiful!"
10,8,phoebe:, oh... okay. 
10,8,rachel:," phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, i mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy... "
10,8,rachel:, and a thousand dollars.
10,8,rachel:," ...is something i'm very interested in! oh please, do not tell ross. he still believes that what's in the inside is important..."
10,8,phoebe:," okay, oh, and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition."
10,8,rachel:, where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving?
10,8,phoebe:," well, i was thinking..."
10,8,rachel:," oh, take the clothes of joey's cabbage patch kid. "
10,8,phoebe:, yeah!   
10,8,monica:, did someone drop the baton again?
10,8,chandler:, why come all the way from kansas to do that?
10,8,monica:, i don't get older. i just get better!
10,8,chandler:," you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon!"
10,8,monica:, you don't know that.
10,8,chandler:, somebody is gonna pick us. 
10,8,monica:," yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!"
10,8,chandler:," i'm telling ya! it's gonna happen. next year it's gonna be you, me and the little hemingway bing. what, he's my favourite author!"
10,8,monica:, name one of his books.
10,8,chandler:," ""the firm""?"
10,8,monica:," ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready..."
10,8,chandler:," you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year. "
10,8,monica:," oh, chandler, that's sweet. but you don't have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do."
10,8,chandler:," i'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile""."
10,8,monica:," ok, let's see... oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no one really cares about it. "
10,8,chandler:, tell me more.
10,8,monica:," okay, i'm gonna go check on something across the hall. you start by washing these not with soap!! "
10,8,chandler:, you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive potatoes! 
10,8,ross:," hey! hey, guess what joey has!"

10,8,chandler:," hmm, the game's at one."
10,8,ross:, so? 
10,8,chandler:," dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back."
10,8,joey:," so we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time."
10,8,chandler:," you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up."
10,8,joey:," dude, two times that happened!"
10,8,chandler:," look, monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
10,8,ross:," he's right, man."
10,8,joey:," right, i guess. alright, so see you at four. "
10,8,chandler:, okay. and get ready to taste my very special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries!
10,8,joey:," that's some gentle comedy, dude. "

10,8,phoebe:," we can't leave now! there was this one baby, haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! this competition just blew wide open, folks!"
10,8,rachel:," phoebe, i think... it's just too weird, i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!"
10,8,phoebe:," oh, i know, we should have been more prepared. it's okay. now, the way i see it, our real competition now is cameron. oh my god, they just took her sweater off. look at those arms! hello michelin man."
10,8,rachel:," oh, phoebe! come on! you know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to emma's group yet. we gotta go, we got dinner!"
10,8,phoebe:," but emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way! "
10,8,rachel:," phoebe, you have to calm down."
10,8,phoebe:," okay. rachel, the hottest babies in the tri state area are in this room right now! i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma!"
10,8,rachel:, really?

10,8,joey:," yeah. i am sorry he's not here too, but i got to say, i am really enjoying nacho chair."
10,8,ross:," yeah, i'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away."
10,8,joey:, ohhhh! these seats are great!
10,8,ross:," i know, i know! when i was here for holidays on ice i was sitting so far away michelle kwan couldn't read my banner!"
10,8,joey:," wow, hey, we'd better get going. if we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner."

10,8,phoebe:," we can say that monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. that way we're right on time! or... or, we can plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her."
10,8,ross:, that would be a good way to get rid of all the pcp we have lying around.
10,8,rachel:," you know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. we'll just act casual. we're not late, we're right on time. "

10,8,rachel:," you guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. we're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. "
10,8,joey:, i had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. 
10,8,monica:, that's all the turkey you're gonna get. 
10,8,ross:, how are we gonna decide who gets this?
10,8,joey:, water balloon! 
10,8,phoebe:, what are we gonna do? i'm starving.
10,8,rachel:," oh, i just remembered. we do have something to eat. monica put something in our oven this morning."
10,8,phoebe:, oh yeah! 
10,8,monica:," hey, you touch that and you will be sorry."
10,8,chandler:," guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger than i've ever seen it. "
10,8,rachel:, huh... oh my god it's brussels sprouts. 
10,8,ross:, that's worse than no food. 
10,8,chandler:, ha ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts!
10,8,monica:, stinky?!
10,8,chandler:, please let me stay on this side of the door. 
10,8,rachel:," oh, i know... i still have my old key! we can just unlock the door."
10,8,phoebe:," well, i don't know if that's such a good idea. they clearly don't want to be with us."
10,8,rachel:," you know what? i don't want to be with them either, but it's thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. "
10,8,joey:," just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? look them in the eye. i know i can get them to forgive us."
10,8,ross:, i don't know...
10,8,joey:, i'm telling ya... i can do it.
10,8,ross:," yeah, he can do it! "
10,8,rachel:, oh! 
10,8,joey:," the turkey, the stuffing... "
10,8,chandler:, the cranberries...?
10,8,monica:, oh! enough! a monkey could have made 'em!
10,8,joey:," hey listen guys, we feel really terrible."
10,8,chandler:," he's doing that weird eye contact thing. don't look at him, don't look at him! "
10,8,joey:," come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. right guys? "
10,8,ross:," so, so sorry."
10,8,joey:," now let's not ruin this day. you worked so hard. let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?"
10,8,chandler:, the floating heads do make a good point.
10,8,monica:," yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad."
10,8,rachel:, so bad.
10,8,phoebe:, so bad.
10,8,monica:," okay, okay. you two go get the dessert. and i'll let you in. "

10,8,monica:," oh my god! you forgot the pies? well, i cannot believe this. you force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that i asked you to do."
10,8,ross:," really girls, not cool."
10,8,chandler:," well, you manheads aren't any better. you lied about going to the game. you knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
10,8,joey:, hey! i'm getting a little tired of this okay? we said we're sorry. it's thanksgiving for pete's sakes! a day of forgiveness!
10,8,ross:, it's a day to be thankful.
10,8,joey:, don't make me come up there!
10,8,monica:, it's too late for apologies.
10,8,joey:, fine! let's just go. i don't need your stupid dinner.
10,8,chandler:, that would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
10,8,rachel:," ewww, is that what that is?"
10,8,joey:, sorry!
10,8,phoebe:," come on you guys, let's just do our own thanksgiving."

10,8,joey:, ha! 
10,8,joey:, oh oh! i'm stuck!
10,8,monica:," joey, that is not gonna work."
10,8,joey:, no seriously... i'm really wedged in here.
10,8,phoebe:, i'll pull you through.
10,8,ross:, okay.
10,8,joey:, aaw ahhh aaahhh stop! stop! i'm worried about damaging my head.
10,8,chandler:, a little late for that.
10,8,joey:," alright, hurry up, you gotta do something."
10,8,monica:," alright, well, this does not change anything. okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face."
10,8,chandler:," uhm, we've got turkey grease."
10,8,monica:, bring it.
10,8,joey:, i just wanna say that i'm sorry i referred to the vein as a seperate person... 
10,8,monica:, here you go! 
10,8,joey:," oh, that smells good! "
10,8,joey:, okay.
10,8,monica:," okay, try it. "
10,8,joey:, it isn't working.
10,8,monica:," alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain."
10,8,joey:," well hurry, i can't feel my ears!"
10,8,chandler:, can you ever feel your ears?
10,8,joey:, interesting...
10,8,monica:," chandler, where are your tools?"
10,8,chandler:," oh, i left them on my bulldozer... i don't have tools!"
10,8,monica:," i do, but rachel borrowed them."
10,8,rachel:, i lent them to ross.
10,8,ross:, i gave them to joey.
10,8,joey:, i left them at the park.
10,8,monica:, oh!
10,8,ross:, i'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
10,8,phoebe:, i've already stuffed a bunch of brussel sprouts down his pants.
10,8,ross:, nice! 
10,8,monica:," okay, i have to get that. now when i get back, i want you and your friends to be gone. thanksgiving is over. the vein has spoken."
10,8,joey:, it's really starting to hurt.
10,8,chandler:," okay, look, i'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? okay, so push!"
10,8,phoebe:," just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here. "
10,8,joey:, ooh! stop putting things down my pants!
10,8,chandler:," come on guys, push!"
10,8,joey:, push! push! push! 
10,8,chandler:, my cranberries!
10,8,joey:," man, i've got food all over me. "
10,8,chandler:, argh! i can't believe what you did. monica's gonna kill you! 
10,8,chandler:, look! look! look what the... look what... look what the floating heads did!
10,8,monica:, i don't care. 
10,8,chandler:, what's going on?
10,8,monica:, that was the adoption agency...
10,8,chandler:, and?
10,8,monica:, we're getting a baby!
10,8,chandler:, are you serious? 
10,8,monica:," there's a pregnant woman in ohio, and she picked us! "
10,8,rachel:, i'm so happy for you!
10,8,monica:, this thanksgiving kicks last thanksgiving's ass! commercial break 
10,8,rachel:, to monica and chandler... and that knocked up girl in ohio.
10,8,ross:, i'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
10,8,phoebe:, i know. have you considered pageanting?
10,8,monica:," i can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. "
10,8,joey:," oh, i know how you feel... "
10,8,rachel:, really?
10,8,joey:," sure. i went through the exact same thing with alicia mae emory... the waiting, the wandering... then one day... i get that call from toys ""r"" us... she was in stock!"
10,8,chandler:, that is the exact same thing.
10,9,chandler:, hi!
10,9,ross:, hey!
10,9,monica:, hey!
10,9,chandler:," we're just here to say goodbye, we're off to ohio."
10,9,phoebe:," oh, right! your adoption interview!"
10,9,monica:," yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby."
10,9,joey:," i can't believe it. when you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! that is so weird!"
10,9,chandler:, and so incorrect!
10,9,monica:, she's only a couple of months pregnant. she liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
10,9,ross:," come on, she's gonna love you guys!"
10,9,chandler:," uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
10,9,monica:, and a lot could still get in our way.
10,9,chandler:," yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.."
10,9,phoebe:, what are you gonna name the baby?
10,9,chandler:, i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word.
10,9,joey:," but just think, ok? what if everything goes right? what if this woman does pick you guys?"
10,9,monica:, oh my god. she's gonna pick us!
10,9,chandler:, so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
10,9,monica:," you know, i know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? if this works out, we're gonna have a baby chandler, a baby!"
10,9,chandler:," yes, but..."
10,9,monica:," oh my god, it's gonna work! we're gonna make it work! i'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! all right, i'll see you suckers. i'm gonna get me... a baby! {she leaves)"
10,9,chandler:," oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!! opening credits "
10,9,rachel:," hey, who's phoebe with?"
10,9,joey:, i'm gonna say someone i'm gonna have sex with. hey!
10,9,phoebe:, hey!
10,9,joey:, so... who's your friend?
10,9,phoebe:," oh, that's sarah. no, no. don't you get any ideas, ok? no, i'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!"
10,9,joey:," ow, why, why, why?"
10,9,phoebe:," because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!"
10,9,joey:," oh, name one friend of yours that i did that with."
10,9,phoebe:, mandy.
10,9,joey:," mandy, uh? uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?"
10,9,phoebe:, no.
10,9,joey:," i know why i don't remember her, huh? "
10,9,rachel:, do you think i'm someone else?
10,9,joey:," ok, i may not have treated your friends well in the past, but i have grown up a lot, really. honest, rach?"
10,9,rachel:," well, believe it or not, it's true. when joey and i were together, he was wonderful. he was thoughtful and mature. and for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!"
10,9,joey:, growth!
10,9,phoebe:," fine, i'll give you her number."
10,9,joey:," ok, thank you. and i promise you i will not forget this one. mandy."
10,9,phoebe:, sarah!
10,9,joey:, saraaah.
10,9,ross:, hey!
10,9,rachel:, hi!
10,9,ross:," hey you guys, i need some fashion advice."
10,9,rachel:, oh!
10,9,ross:, how does this look?
10,9,rachel:," well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... there you go! now throw it away!"
10,9,ross:, c'mon! this looks good!
10,9,rachel:," ross, please, trust me. i buy 30 fashion magazines a month. now, i don't know who's running for president or who that... nato guy is, but i do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat."
10,9,ross:, damnit! i have this date tomorrow night and i have to look cool!
10,9,phoebe:," well, you know, if you want fashion help, rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow. you're more than welcome to come with us, right?"
10,9,ross:," really? that would be great. i mean, i have to do something, she kinda teased me about how i dress. "
10,9,joey:," i can see why, nice shirt!"
10,9,ross:, you're wearing the same shirt.
10,9,joey:," please, make yourself comfortable and i will back in a moment with erica."
10,9,monica:," ok, thank you. uh, well this is it. are you ok?"
10,9,chandler:," ""hi, i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?"""
10,9,monica:," uh, we're gonna be great."
10,9,chandler:, you're gonna be great.
10,9,monica:," monica, chandler. i'd like you to meet erica."
10,9,monica:," hi. it is so, so nice to meet you."
10,9,erica:, hi...
10,9,chandler:, thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
10,9,erica:, i'll let you get acquainted.
10,9,chandler:, ok.
10,9,erica:," so, it's monica and chandler. i only know you as file 0w33815 d."
10,9,chandler:, that's what our friends call us.
10,9,erica:," gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. it's... kind of intimidating."
10,9,monica:, i don't know about that.
10,9,erica:," you're kidding me? i mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. but on top of it, you're married to a reverend?"
10,9,chandler:, i don't think that's exactly...
10,9,monica:," let her finish, doctor.   "
10,9,phoebe:, hey!
10,9,joey:, hey.
10,9,phoebe:," oh, my friend sarah had a great time last night."
10,9,joey:, well...
10,9,phoebe:, yeah! so you're gonna call this one back?
10,9,joey:, nope.
10,9,phoebe:, what are you talking about? sarah's great!
10,9,joey:," oh, really? you know what your great friend did? we're out to dinner, ok? we're getting along, having a really nice time. i was thinking she was really cool. and then, out of nowhere... "
10,9,phoebe:," thats it? thats why you wont go out with her again? so, she took some fries, big deal!"
10,9,joey:," hey, hey, look! its not about a few fries... its about what the fries represent."
10,9,phoebe:, what?
10,9,joey:, all food!
10,9,phoebe:," im sorry, i cant believe i set you up with such a monster!"
10,9,joey:," hey, hey, hey, hey. look. i take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! the more, the better! all right? just dont order a garden salad and then eat my food! thats a good way to lose some fingers! "
10,9,phoebe:, oh
10,9,rachel:, hi
10,9,phoebe:, thank god youre here. listen to this!
10,9,rachel:, what?
10,9,phoebe:, joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
10,9,rachel:," oh! oh, no! "
10,9,phoebe:, what? you know about the plate thing?
10,9,rachel:," oh, yeah. joey doesnt share food. i mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ..."
10,9,phoebe:, you wouldnt let her have a grape?
10,9,rachel:, oh no! not me! emma! 
10,9,joey:, joey doesnt share food!
10,9,phoebe:," well, i still think that its a stupid reason not to call someone again. you are calling her! and if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!"
10,9,joey:," i like that! a sharing buffer! yeah! ill order some extra fries! maybe a plate of onion rings. yeah. and a shrimp cocktail. and some buffalo wings. maybe an individual pizza, uh? and some mozzarella sticks. what were we talking about? "
10,9,phoebe:, this place is awesome!
10,9,ross:," you know, we should just go, im not gonna find anything here! this stuff is ridiculous! "
10,9,rachel:," ah, this place is great!"
10,9,phoebe:, wow!
10,9,ross:," rach, come on, im not gonna wear any of this! nothing silver. . ok? nothing with hair! and nothing with padlocks on it! ."
10,9,rachel:," ross, look, i know that some of this stuff is out there, but i mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . i mean, this is just beautiful!"
10,9,ross:," wow, this is really soft . three hundred and fifty dollars?"
10,9,rachel:," yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!"
10,9,ross:," hey, check this out! its totally you!"
10,9,ross:, wow!
10,9,phoebe:, yeah! 
10,9,ross:, actually this looks like pretty good! yeah! boys will be boys?
10,9,phoebe:, what? they will be!
10,9,ross:," all right, thats it, im getting out of here."
10,9,rachel:," no, no, no, no! ross, wait! come on! you know, theres other stuff. heres a nice shirt, look at these nice pants..."
10,9,ross:," uh, actually these might look pretty good on me."
10,9,rachel:," yes, they will! you know what you should do? just go take a walk, all right? i know your size and im... im gonna pick up some really good stuff for you."
10,9,ross:, really?
10,9,rachel:," yes! and i know what looks sexy on guys. please, just wear what i suggest, and shes gonna go nuts for you."
10,9,ross:," so, youre saying, uh, if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers?"
10,9,rachel:, why do men keep talking to me like this? 
10,9,chandler:," so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wifes a reverend, thats important to you?"
10,9,erica:," yeah, i read some great applications, but then i thought who better then a minister to raise a child!"
10,9,monica:, amen.
10,9,chandler:, plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
10,9,monica:," uh, good hands. healing hands."
10,9,erica:," reverend, can i ask? does the bible say anything about adoption?"
10,9,monica:, it says do it!. and behold she did adopt onto them a baby. and it was good.
10,9,erica:, wow.
10,9,chandler:," yeah, wow."
10,9,erica:, i was wondering you both have such serious jobs. would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
10,9,monica:," oh, you know, my flock is good, i mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. good flock. flock, flock, flock."
10,9,erica:, being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
10,9,chandler:," so, hows everything going in here?"
10,9,erica:, do you have any question for erica?
10,9,chandler:," yes, our system assures total anonimity. were very proud of it."
10,9,chandler:," well, then if theres nothing else, then the two of us should talk."
10,9,erica:," actually, i dont think we have to."
10,9,monica:, we dont?
10,9,erica:," yeah, when i read about you two, i was pretty sure i wanted you, but i just thought we should meet face to face. . i've made my decision. i choose them."
10,9,monica:," oh my god, this is great! this is so great! . did you hear that?"
10,9,chandler:," yeah, i did."
10,9,monica:," hey, thank you. thank you so much. . you are so going to heaven! "
10,9,rachel:, we got some really great stuff!
10,9,phoebe:," yeah, yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got."
10,9,rachel:, oh! really? do you wanna try some of them on for me? 
10,9,phoebe:," oh! okay. wait, are we in joey's imagination?"
10,9,rachel:," oh no! i took one of ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing."
10,9,phoebe:," oh, well, ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.    "
10,9,ross:, so? what do you think? 
10,9,joey:, i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
10,9,ross:, yeah! yeah! rachel picked it out for me. she told me to trust her and you know what? i'm glad i did! i turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
10,9,joey:," dude, i really don't think you should be wearing that."
10,9,ross:," oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?"
10,9,joey:, looks like someone is the ladies!!
10,9,ross:," you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. yeah, now if you'll excuse me i have a date. see? all eyes on me!   "
10,9,chandler:, we are not signing those papers.
10,9,monica:, why not?
10,9,chandler:, it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else.
10,9,monica:, god works in mysterious ways.
10,9,chandler:, you have gotta stop!
10,9,monica:, but she liked us.
10,9,chandler:, she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.
10,9,monica:," well, if you think about it, i am kind of like a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing the hungry and poor. "
10,9,chandler:," your veal chop is $34,95!"
10,9,monica:," c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now."
10,9,chandler:, but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this?
10,9,monica:, because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no one will ever love that baby more than us.
10,9,chandler:, i know..
10,9,monica:," i mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if no one ever picks us?"
10,9,chandler:," oh, honey.."
10,9,monica:," please.. please, we are so close."
10,9,chandler:," monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to. "
10,9,monica:," okay, right. "
10,9,chandler:," so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
10,9,monica:, maybe she will. uh! why couldn't i have been a reverend?
10,9,chandler:, you're jewish.
10,9,monica:, technicality!   
10,9,waiter:, a garden salad for the lady 
10,9,joey:," oh, that looks great! good ordering!"
10,9,waiter:, seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. enjoy!
10,9,sarah:," mmmh, those fries look delicious."
10,9,joey:," oh, i didn't know you liked french fries. help yourself! what's mine is yours. "
10,9,sarah:," oh wow, are those stuffed clams?"
10,9,joey:," uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams. "
10,9,joey:," how about those fries though, huh? "
10,9,sarah:, they are delicious 
10,9,joey:," you are beautiful, you know that?"
10,9,sarah:," oh, that is so sweet.."
10,9,joey:, oh okay.. 
10,9,joey:, now look what you did!!
10,9,sarah:, what? what is the matter with you?
10,9,joey:," i don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?"
10,9,sarah:," but you just said ""what's mine is yours""?"
10,9,joey:," well, i didn't mean it!"
10,9,sarah:," fine, i'm sorry, i didn't think it was that big a deal."
10,9,joey:," i'm sorry, i'm overreacting. okay, it's just when it comes to food, i have certain rules, okay, i mean there are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do .    "
10,9,girl:," wow, this place looks great."
10,9,ross:," oh! you are gonna love it! and i'm so glad, we're finally doing this."
10,9,girl:, me too! 
10,9,ross:, here so this was fun!   
10,9,joey:," i really am sorry about, you know..before. i just want to make sure you know that i really do like you."
10,9,sarah:, sure just not as much as clams.
10,9,joey:," well, stuffed clams. "
10,9,waiter:," chocolate torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman."
10,9,joey:," uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake."

10,9,erica:, hey.
10,9,chandler:," so, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. there's a lot to go over, but i'll explain everything as we go through it."
10,9,monica:, i is... is that a picture?
10,9,erica:, yeah. it's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. i thought you might want to see it. 
10,9,monica:, i don't understand.
10,9,chandler:, the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor.
10,9,erica:, that's impossible.
10,9,chandler:, i'll go check your file. excuse me.
10,9,erica:, so who are you?
10,9,chandler:," well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york."
10,9,monica:," yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. "
10,9,erica:, so you lied to me before?
10,9,monica:," well, we... ""bore false witness""... see i could be a reverend."
10,9,erica:, i can't believe this. 
10,9,monica:, but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
10,9,erica:, giving you my baby? you think i'd give you my child after this?
10,9,monica:," well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file..."
10,9,erica:, i don't want to look at your file! this is over. 
10,9,chandler:, erica wait!
10,9,erica:, i've nothing to say to you. 
10,9,chandler:, you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
10,9,erica:, why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
10,9,chandler:," erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising."
10,9,erica:," oh yeah. i actually liked you guys. but it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. "
10,9,chandler:," but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please? "
10,9,chandler:, you still want that baby? 
10,9,monica:, god bless you chandler bing! commercial break 
10,9,ross:, turns out this sweater is made for a woman.

10,10,monica:, i would get a room with this cake. i think i could show this cake a good time!
10,10,phoebe:," if you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?"
10,10,monica:, sex!
10,10,chandler:," seriously, answer faster!"
10,10,monica:," oh, i'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" i wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!"

10,10,phoebe:," ross, how about you. what would you give up, sex or food?"
10,10,ross:, food.

10,10,phoebe:," you know, i'm always right about these things."
10,10,rachel:," no, you're not! last week you thought ross was trying to kill you!"
10,10,phoebe:," well, i'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! see, there's something going on with them. look, he's getting into the car with her!"
10,10,rachel:," oh, that doesn't mean anything."

10,10,chandler:," well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!"
10,10,monica:, so? what do you think of the house?
10,10,chandler:, its perfect. its everything weve been looking for.
10,10,monica:, isnt it? then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 
10,10,chandler:, and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? what were the things you said?
10,10,monica:, dont you love the huge yard?

10,10,chandler:," i dont know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancys car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day."
10,10,monica:, gotcha. when do we tell them about this?
10,10,chandler:," we dont. not until it's a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
10,10,monica:, okay. right. oh my god that is gonna be so hard.
10,10,chandler:, i know. gooooood luck with it.

10,10,joey:," chandler? forty five minutes? well, something is not right. i just cant believe he would do this to monica!"
10,10,ross:," i know, and with the baby coming?"
10,10,phoebe:," so, should we tell her?"
10,10,ross:," i dont know. phoebe, if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?"
10,10,phoebe:, why? whod you seen him with?
10,10,ross:," no one, im just saying if... "
10,10,phoebe:, tell me what you know!
10,10,ross:," i know nothing! mikes a great guy, it was hypothetical!"
10,10,phoebe:," all right. . he is a good guy. youre right, he wouldnt cheat."
10,10,ross:, who did you see him with?

10,10,monica:," no, hes picking up dinner, why, whats up?"
10,10,phoebe:, all right...
10,10,ross:, we think chandler might be having an affair.
10,10,monica:, what?
10,10,rachel:, phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester.
10,10,phoebe:, they went in together. so sorry.
10,10,monica:, oh my god! oh my god thats awful! what did you think of the house? 
10,10,phoebe:, what?
10,10,joey:," monica, you understand what we are saying, right?"
10,10,monica:," yeah, sure... uhm, i'm devastated, obviously... did you think the neighborhood was homey? "
10,10,chandler:, hey!
10,10,joey:, you son of a bitch!
10,10,chandler:," is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?"
10,10,monica:, phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
10,10,rachel:, who's nancy?
10,10,ross:, what's going on?
10,10,monica:," ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big."
10,10,chandler:, yeah i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.
10,10,joey:, i knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
10,10,phoebe:, why do you have a realtor?
10,10,monica:," uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city."
10,10,joey:, what?
10,10,rachel:, are you serious?
10,10,monica:," when we found out that we're gonna get this baby, chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city."
10,10,phoebe:, so you're gonna move?
10,10,ross:, oh my god.
10,10,joey:, shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
10,10,rachel:," what is wrong with raising a kid in the city? i'm doing it, ross is doing it, sarah jessica parker is doing it!"
10,10,monica:," and that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset..."
10,10,chandler:, ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice cream truck can go by.
10,10,ross:, so you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
10,10,phoebe:," have you thought about what you would be giving up? you can't move out of the city, what if you want chinese food at 5am? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door?"
10,10,ross:," you know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay."
10,10,joey:," no, no, it's not, don't listen to him! i'm gonna thump you! "
10,10,ross:," it's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be. "
10,10,chandler:," actually, we already found a house we love."
10,10,ross:, what?
10,10,monica:," and about an hour ago, we made an offer. "
10,10,chandler:," bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh? time lapse"
10,10,ross:, you put an offer on a house? 
10,10,monica:, it's so sweet. it really is. it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... 
10,10,phoebe:," wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers?"
10,10,chandler:, i know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
10,10,joey:," is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food? because i can stop doing that, i really, really think i can! "
10,10,chandler:, you know that's not the reason joe. 
10,10,monica:," we think if you saw it, you'd understand. i mean you guys were there. it is beautiful, isn't it?"
10,10,rachel:, yeah it is.
10,10,joey:, what the hell are you doin'?
10,10,rachel:," i can't believe chandler is screwing this woman, but man this would be a nice place to live!"
10,10,phoebe:," yeah, but so is this."
10,10,ross:," yeah, i mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. i mean, how can you leave this place?   "
10,10,rachel:," c'mon daddy, listen to me! all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a a purse, y'know? or a or a hat! no, i don't want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying that i am a ha it's a metaphor, daddy!"
10,10,ross:, you can see where he'd have trouble.
10,10,rachel:, well maybe i'll just stay here with monica.

10,11,roy:," well, look it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory."
10,11,phoebe:," oh yeah, okay. i'm uptight. yeah, that's why i don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what i can only assume is a child halloween costume! "
10,11,roy:," i may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath ... is all man."
10,11,phoebe:," i'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?"

10,11,ross:, because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time.
10,11,chandler:, you kissed her that night too?
10,11,monica:," two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed."
10,11,chandler:," seriously, where did this happen?"
10,11,ross:," okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right. she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips. i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back. it was only for a second, but... it was amazing. and now, now i find out that you kissed her first."
10,11,chandler:, oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?
10,11,ross:, mine.
10,11,chandler:, i'm pretty sure i put her on my bed.
10,11,ross:," no, she was definitely on my bed. "
10,11,chandler:," why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?"
10,11,ross:," well, then who was on my bed?"
10,11,monica:," oh! oh, oh! "
10,11,ross:," no! no, no!"
10,11,monica:, yes! 
10,11,ross:, you were under the pile of coats?
10,11,monica:, i was the pile of coats!
10,11,ross:, oh my god!
10,11,monica:, you were my midnight mystery kisser?
10,11,ross:, you were my first kiss with rachel?
10,11,monica:, you were my first kiss ever?
10,11,chandler:, what did i marry into? commercial break   
10,11,monica:," oh, crap! the end"
10,12,phoebe:," oh, hey joey."
10,12,joey:," uh, hey."
10,12,phoebe:," listen, i need to ask you something. ok, you know how my step dad's in prison."
10,12,joey:, yeah.
10,12,phoebe:," yeah. well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till monday."
10,12,joey:, so he can't come?
10,12,phoebe:," no, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, i would just really love it if you would do it."
10,12,joey:, seriously? 
10,12,phoebe:," yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. i mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom..."
10,12,joey:, i am pretty wisdomous.
10,12,phoebe:, so... what do you say?
10,12,joey:," are you kidding? phoebe, i would be honored. "
10,12,phoebe:," oh, thank you. i hope... i hope you know how much you mean to me."
10,12,joey:," listen, i hope... that you know... i don't want you to see your father cry, go to your room!   opening credits "
10,12,phoebe:, oh.
10,12,joey:," oh no, no, no, let your dad get this."
10,12,phoebe:," oh, it's my wedding planner. she's driving me crazy! hello... hey, ok, stop screaming! ok? so, halibut. all right, so salmon, either way. i don't i don't... it doesn't matter to me! "
10,12,monica:," well, it matters to me!"
10,12,phoebe:," well, i don't care, so you pick!"
10,12,monica:," did you just hung up on me? all right, look, i need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours."
10,12,phoebe:, uh uh. ok. what time is that.
10,12,monica:, you don't know military time?
10,12,phoebe:," why, i must have been in missile training the day they taught that."
10,12,monica:, just subtract twelve.
10,12,phoebe:," ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and..."
10,12,monica:, six o'clock!
10,12,phoebe:, ok.
10,12,monica:," ok. hold on. geller here! no! i said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. goodbye. oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?"
10,12,phoebe:, ice sculpture? that sounds really fancy! i told you i just want a simple wedding.
10,12,monica:," please... honey, leave the details to me. now i wanna make this day as special for you as i can. now, ok, i was thinking that the harpist should wear white."
10,12,phoebe:, what harpist? my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums.
10,12,monica:, ooh... she backed out.
10,12,phoebe:, she did? why?
10,12,monica:," i made her. steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". nor does marjorie's overwhelming scent."
10,12,phoebe:, hey! she will shower when tibet is free.   
10,12,chandler:, hey!
10,12,phoebe:, hey!
10,12,chandler:," you look great. i'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them. "
10,12,phoebe:," okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?"
10,12,chandler:, no stupid jokes. i thought that was for the actual wedding.
10,12,phoebe:, rehearse it!
10,12,ross:, hi! 
10,12,mike:, thanks for coming you guys.
10,12,ross:," oh, hey, oh... i... i was i was going for a hand shake."

10,12,rachel:, yeah.
10,12,phoebe:, where is emma?
10,12,rachel:," oh, monica made me send her to my mother's. apparently babies and weddings don't mix."
10,12,monica:," are you still crying about your damn baby? pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. your see these clowns all the time! "
10,12,joey:," yes, we are."

10,12,joey:," hey, i'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? but i'm just trying to be nice for the kids! "
10,12,chandler:, you know what i just realized? we have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
10,12,ross:," yeah, i thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? when did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?"
10,12,rachel:, uh... november?
10,12,ross:, i wanna say it's not looking good.
10,12,rachel:, hey pheebs...

10,12,ross:, what? 
10,12,rachel:," well, this is really awkward oh, and i can leave!"
10,12,phoebe:," i'm sorry you guys but, you know, mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just you just missed the cut."
10,12,ross:," oh, man!"

10,12,ross:, football!
10,12,chandler:, thank you.
10,12,monica:," pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it."

10,12,monica:," yeah, i changed them. i i sent you a fax about it!"
10,12,phoebe:, i don't have a fax machine.
10,12,monica:," ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!"
10,12,ross:, i can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
10,12,chandler:," i know, i hate being left out of things."
10,12,ross:, and it's a wedding! it'd be weird if i'm not in it...
10,12,mike:," hey guys, how is it going?"
10,12,chandler:, fine. we're just sitting here. alone. doing nothing. it's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
10,12,mike:," yeah look, about tomorrow, i... i've got a question for ya. i just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it."
10,12,chandler:, what happened?
10,12,ross:," who cares, and?"
10,12,mike:," ...and i was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... "
10,12,ross:, i'll do it!

10,12,mike:, you both wanna do it? uhm... there's only room for one.
10,12,chandler:," pick me, i look great in a tux and i will not steal focus."
10,12,ross:," no, mike, no, no. you wanna pick me, i mean... watch! huh?"
10,12,mike:," you know, i really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. you know, phoebe knows you better, i'm gonna let her choose. "
10,12,ross:," well, if phoebe's choosing, then say hello to mike's next groomsman."
10,12,chandler:," oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me!"
10,12,ross:," please, you're going down!"
10,12,chandler:, you are going downer!
10,12,ross:, is that what they say on the figure skating team?
10,12,chandler:," i wouldn't know, i didn't make it!   "
10,12,joey:," so, you know i'm filling in for phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?"
10,12,mike:," yeah, yeah. hey, thanks for doing that."
10,12,joey:," oh, hey, my pleasure. so what are your intentions with my phoebe?"
10,12,mike:, i intend to marry her.
10,12,joey:," oh, a wiseacre. . no, no, no, i understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? isn't that kind of unstable?"
10,12,mike:, no more so than acting.
10,12,joey:, strike two!
10,12,mike:," you're right. she probably will support me. hey, unless we move in with you, dad?"
10,12,joey:," strike three! you only get one more, mike! "
10,12,ross:," so, what did you decide?"
10,12,phoebe:, i decided to pee.
10,12,chandler:, mike didn't tell you? you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen fell out.
10,12,phoebe:," oh no, no. i can't choose between you two! i love you both so much!"
10,12,chandler:, just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
10,12,phoebe:," oh, i don't wanna choose! it's . oh okay, wait. rach! listen i have a very special bridesmaid task for you today."
10,12,rachel:," goody, what is it!"
10,12,phoebe:," well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between ross and chandler. so good luck with that."
10,12,rachel:," what, what, what, no, i don't wanna do that."
10,12,phoebe:," all right, i guess i'll have to find a new bridesmaid."
10,12,ross:, i'll do it! 
10,12,monica:," ok, it's 2100 hours. time for your toast. "
10,12,mike:, do i have a minute to go to the bathroom?
10,12,monica:," you had a bathroom break at 2030. pee on your own time, mike! . now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. okay. you just get in, do your thing and get out!"
10,12,mike:, is that what you say to chandler?
10,12,monica:," it's 2101 and i am not amused. . ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. "
10,12,phoebe:, oh god.
10,12,phoebe:," and... moment's over! so, ok, uh, i can forget that. i can forget that and uhm... oh this is funny! oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... oh, ok, well, uhm, i . ok, ok, i, ok, i.... monica i can't do it like this! this is my wedding! okay, i don't want this or this or this ok? i just wanted a simple wedding! where my fiancee can go to the bathroom anytime he wants! you know what? you're done."
10,12,monica:, what?
10,12,phoebe:, you're fired! cheers!   
10,12,phoebe:, hey!
10,12,rachel:, happy wedding day!
10,12,phoebe:," oh, happy my wedding day to you!"
10,12,rachel:," ok dokey, joey, listen. this is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? we're gonna have hair and make up going on in the bathroom and oh, i had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages."
10,12,joey:," oh, man! i wouldn't have had breakfast if i knew there was going to be corsages! "
10,12,monica:," hi. about last night... i know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... my point is, uh, well, i'm willing to take my job back."
10,12,phoebe:," oh, well that's ok. i think you and i will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid."
10,12,monica:," oh, is that so? ok. if that's really what you want, then here... i give you the headset. well, i don't really want to give you the headset. well i guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. "
10,12,phoebe:," wow, this is a lot!"
10,12,monica:," uh huh, but i'm sure you can handle this. i mean, i have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, i'm sure you'll do fine."
10,12,phoebe:, you won awards?
10,12,monica:, mm mh. i printed them out on my computer. 
10,12,ross:, hey!
10,12,monica:, hi.
10,12,ross:, where's rach?
10,12,monica:," she's in her room, why?"
10,12,ross:," i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? i'm not gonna watch chandler up there while i'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . oh! my god! you're breathtaking! "
10,12,rachel:, what d'you want?
10,12,ross:," you haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?"
10,12,rachel:," oh, ross, c'mon, please! don't make this harder than it already is!"
10,12,ross:, i'm not! i'm making it easier! pick me!
10,12,rachel:," well, chandler said that it's really important to him too!"
10,12,ross:," listen, listen. whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! now, i promise i won't say a word, but if you pick chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!"
10,12,rachel:," oh, you are the lesser of two evils!"
10,12,ross:," yes, yes!   "
10,12,phoebe:, sven i don't understand what you're saying! what is wrong with the flowers? lorkins? what the hell are lorkins? 
10,12,monica:, i know. .
10,12,mike:, hey.
10,12,phoebe:," listen, mike, if you were swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?"
10,12,mike:, orchids?
10,12,phoebe:, right there! that's why i'm marrying you! 
10,12,joey:, hello michael.
10,12,mike:, joseph.
10,12,joey:," may i have a word with you, please?"
10,12,mike:, this is... great...
10,12,joey:," have a seat. last night, i tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... i cannot allow this. "
10,12,mike:, are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
10,12,joey:," thissa time itsa personal."" "
10,12,mike:," joey, i kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?"
10,12,joey:," i want you to take this seriously! phoebe is very very important to me, ok? and i wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her."
10,12,mike:," joe, i love phoebe. she's the single most important thing in my life. i'd die before i let anything happen to her. "
10,12,joey:," that's what i wanted to hear! because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family. "
10,12,mike:, that must have been one lousy movie.
10,12,joey:, that was me!   
10,12,rachel:, hi
10,12,chandler:," hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
10,12,rachel:," even so, i think i'm gonna pick ross."
10,12,chandler:," let me tell you why you need to pick me. see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if i'm the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. "
10,12,rachel:," all right fine, i pick you."
10,12,chandler:," y y yeeesss! make ""groom"" for chandler."
10,12,rachel:, oh my...   
10,12,phoebe:," no! we're gonna do it my way. because your way is stupid! alright i gotta go, i have another call, reverend. hello? "
10,12,joey:, i'm glad we had this little talk.
10,12,mike:," yes. yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. that didn't make me uncomfortable at all! alright, so i'll see everybody tonight?"
10,12,phoebe:, okay.
10,12,monica:, bye. 
10,12,mike:," uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall? "
10,12,phoebe:," oh my god, what's it doing here? "
10,12,monica:," ugh, i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. uh! what a pickle."
10,12,phoebe:," oh my god, everything is such a mess. why is this happening to me? "
10,12,joey:, how bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?   
10,12,chandler:, how's it going? 
10,12,ross:, good. i'm just getting some coffee. so i'm alert for the wedding.
10,12,chandler:, that's what i was doing too.

10,12,chandler:, you too. 
10,12,ross:," oh, i will."
10,12,chandler:, me too. 
10,12,ross:," wait a minute, i know why i'm being such an ass, why are you? "
10,12,chandler:, i'm not supposed to tell you. 
10,12,ross:, i'm not supposed to tell you! 
10,12,chandler:, you told us both we could be in the wedding? 
10,12,rachel:," well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other."
10,12,ross:," rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. you and me together again. "
10,12,chandler:," rach, rach, knock knock."
10,12,rachel:, who's there?
10,12,chandler:, i'll tell you at the wedding.
10,12,rachel:, uh. 
10,12,mike:," hey, i forgot my scarf. "
10,12,rachel:," you know what, i can't do this. i don't know which one of you guys to pick. "
10,12,mike:," oh, you haven't picked yet. oh good, 'cause i had an idea. i thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. chappy. "
10,12,ross:, what? a dog? no! rachel gets to choose. 
10,12,rachel:," wow, this is a tough one. i think i'm gonna have to go with the dog. "
10,12,phoebe:," alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? are you, are you freaking kidding me!? "
10,12,monica:, how's it going? 
10,12,phoebe:, help me.
10,12,monica:, what? 
10,12,phoebe:, i want you to be crazy bitch again. 
10,12,monica:, really? 
10,12,phoebe:, please? 
10,12,monica:, you really want me to come back?
10,12,phoebe:, more than i wanna get married.
10,12,monica:," ok people, we are back in business! oh god, we've missed you soo much! ok, go and get your hair and make up done, and i'll take care of everything. "
10,12,joey:," hey, what are you guys gonna do?"
10,12,phoebe:, about what?
10,12,joey:," the blizzard. i just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! they already closed all the bridges and tunnels. "
10,12,monica:, ooh! but the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from new jersey!
10,12,joey:, i don't think they are.
10,12,ross:, haha! looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. so sorry pheebs.   
10,12,monica:," well, the club lost it's power."
10,12,joey:," yeah according to the news, most of the city did."
10,12,rachel:, since when do you watch the news? 
10,12,joey:," uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl."
10,12,ross:, i can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
10,12,phoebe:, i know.
10,12,rachel:," wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. you always wanted to get married outside. why don't you guys just do it on the street?"
10,12,phoebe:, what? 
10,12,rachel:," well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. i mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. this could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!"
10,12,phoebe:, what do you think? 
10,12,mike:, i think i wanna get married to you today. 
10,12,phoebe:," me too! monica, do you think we could do it?"
10,12,monica:, affirmative!   
10,12,monica:, michael!
10,12,mike:," i crushed a pill and put it in her drink... come on, sweetheart."
10,12,mike:," you know, chappy's too small to handle all this snow. someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle."
10,12,chandler:," so technically, would this person be in the wedding?"
10,12,mike:, i'll do it!
10,12,ross:," no, but chandler, hello... aren't you scared of dogs?"
10,12,chandler:, i'm not scared. i'll just take little chappy and... he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed.
10,12,ross:," well, i guess i'm in the wedding then. ha haaa... he stinks!"
10,12,monica:," level 1 alert. i repeat, level 1. this is not a drill. okay we've got a situation. the minister just called. he's snowed in. he can't make it."
10,12,mike:," oh, no! "
10,12,joey:," oh hey, don't worry. i'm still ordained from your wedding."
10,12,monica:, really?
10,12,joey:," yeah, you'd think i'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? huhuh..."
10,12,ross:," uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free."
10,12,joey:," i had to read the bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do."
10,12,monica:," okay, if joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle."
10,12,chandler:, i'll do it.
10,12,ross:, i'll...
10,12,chandler:, na ha ha... ne he he... ah ah...
10,12,monica:," okay, mike and joey, get in position. chandler, come with me. "
10,12,monica:," okay, joey's doing the ceremony and chandler's giving you away."
10,12,phoebe:," oh, okay. hi new dad. "
10,12,monica:," so, you're ready to do this?"
10,12,phoebe:," uhuh, uhuh... oh my god! this is really happening."
10,12,rachel:," oh phoebe, i'm so happy for you honey. "
10,12,phoebe:," oh, thank you."
10,12,monica:," i love you. oh, wait, wait, wait! no hugs. the dresses... oh what the hell. "
10,12,phoebe:, i love you.
10,12,monica:, okay. it's zero hour. all teams execute on my count. let's get this bad boy on the road.
10,12,chandler:, is it okay that i want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
10,12,monica:, i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
10,12,chandler:, oh yeah! 
10,12,monica:," okay marjorie, hit it. "

10,13,rachel:," wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?"
10,13,ross:," no, look, uh. you are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and i just don't feel it would be right, i'd feel like i'd be, you know, taking advantage of you."
10,13,rachel:," taking advantage? i'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!"
10,13,ross:," look, i'm sure it would be great, but i i think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, i'm gonna go!"
10,13,rachel:, wow. ok.
10,13,ross:, i'll see you in the morning .
10,13,rachel:, mhm mh!
10,13,ross:," haven't had sex in four months, i should get a medal for that!   "
10,13,erica:, thanks so much for taking me to all those places. i had a great time.
10,13,monica:," oh, i'm glad. listen, i want to apologize about chandler, though. i just did not see this coming."
10,13,chandler:, new york is awesome!
10,13,monica:, what is with you?
10,13,chandler:," yeah, i've been to these places before, but i've never really seen them, you know."
10,13,monica:," yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo ing."
10,13,erica:, thanks so much for showing me around.
10,13,monica:, oh! it was our pleasure. we are so much enjoying getting to know you.
10,13,erica:," well, if there is anything else you wanna know... "
10,13,chandler:," oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father? "
10,13,erica:," oh, sure. yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. "
10,13,chandler:, that's great. 
10,13,erica:, yeah... it's almost definitely him. 
10,13,monica:, how's that now?
10,13,erica:," well, there is a chance it's another guy. i mean, i have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. "
10,13,chandler:," so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too? "
10,13,erica:," no, he's in prison. "
10,13,monica:, was he falsely accused of something? 
10,13,erica:," no... he killed his father with a shovel. but other than that, he's a great guy. "
10,13,chandler:, i'll bet his dad doesn't think so. 
10,13,monica:, are you awake? 
10,13,chandler:, of course i'm awake. assume from now on that i'm always awake! 
10,13,monica:," alright, we don't know that it's him. i mean, it could be the football guy. "
10,13,chandler:," honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel killer."
10,13,monica:," alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? no! would we treat him any differently?"
10,13,chandler:, i'd keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is. 
10,13,monica:, how? 
10,13,chandler:," i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
10,13,monica:," yeah, but maybe we're just over reacting. "
10,13,chandler:," pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel wielding arm!   "
10,13,tape:," we will now count from one to five. un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq."
10,13,joey:," huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!"
10,13,tape:, good job.
10,13,joey:, thank you. 
10,13,phoebe:, hey joey.
10,13,joey:, hey!
10,13,phoebe:," listen, i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought about it a lot and, and i know, i was too impatient. so lets try it again."
10,13,joey:," oh, no, that's okay, i don't need your help. i worked on it myself and i gotta say, i am pretty good!"
10,13,phoebe:," really, can i hear some of it. "
10,13,joey:," sure, sure. ok, ""bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"" see?"
10,13,phoebe:," well, you're not, you're not... you're not... again, you're not speaking french! "
10,13,joey:," oh well i think i am, yeah and i think i'm definitely gonna get the part."
10,13,phoebe:, how could you possibly think that? 
10,13,joey:," for one thing, the guy on the tape said i was doing a good job!   "
10,13,ross:," hey rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee? "
10,13,rachel:, sure. 
10,13,ross:, you've been quiet all morning. is everything okay? 
10,13,rachel:, hmm hmm. 
10,13,ross:, you sure you're alright?
10,13,rachel:, yep.
10,13,ross:," o kay. well, i'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. "
10,13,rachel:, fyi..
10,13,ross:, there it is... 
10,13,rachel:," in the future, when a girl asks for some ill advised sympathy sex... just do it. "
10,13,ross:," wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night? i was just trying to do the right thing."
10,13,rachel:," really? well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!"
10,13,ross:, well...
10,13,rachel:, oh stop that! 
10,13,ross:, i can't believe this. i was just being a good guy. i treated you with respect and understanding. 
10,13,rachel:," oh, that is so hot. she walks around him to the other side)"
10,13,ross:," hey, i was looking out for you."
10,13,rachel:," oh, really, well ross, you know what? i am a big girl. i don't need someone telling me what is best for me."
10,13,ross:," i gotta say, i have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever."
10,13,rachel:," oh, really, really? well, it wasn't very good for me either. "
10,13,ross:," hey you know what? you know what? to avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again."
10,13,rachel:, what?
10,13,ross:," that's right, sex is off the table. i am never having sex with you again. dr. green, are you feeling better?   "
10,13,chandler:, hey! how was lunch?
10,13,erica:," we had a good time. by the way, i wanted to ask you something. it would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, jiminy billy bob "
10,13,chandler:," oh, really? "
10,13,erica:," no! you we're right, that was fun! i'm gonna go finish packing."
10,13,chandler:," o okay. so, is she gonna take the test?"
10,13,monica:," nope, she doesn't have to, i found out who the father is."
10,13,chandler:," oh god. it's shovely joe, isn't it? "
10,13,monica:, no it's not. 
10,13,chandler:, how do you know? 
10,13,erica:," well, it turns out that erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way. "
10,13,chandler:, oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
10,13,monica:, the thing we never do.
10,13,chandler:, shovely joe!   
10,13,director:, whenever you're ready joey.

10,13,phoebe:," Ã©coutez, je vais vous dire la vÃ©ritÃ©. c'est mon petit frÃ¨re. il est un peu retardÃ©. "
10,13,phoebe:," alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... "
10,13,director:," good job, little buddy. that was some really good french. but i think we're gonna go with someone else for the part."

10,13,ross:," oh, no problem."
10,13,rachel:," and also, you know i uh, i was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again."
10,13,ross:, thank you. i'm glad you agree.
10,13,rachel:," it's a shame though, i mean, when we did it, it was pretty good."
10,13,ross:," yeah... yeah, that's true."

10,13,rachel:, not even one more time?
10,13,ross:, not even once.
10,13,rachel:, no matter how much we want it.
10,13,ross:, even if we want it really bad.
10,13,rachel:, that's what we decided.
10,13,ross:," uhm, right!"
10,13,rachel:, ...it's kinda hard though!
10,13,ross:, yeah.

10,15,rachel:," i mean, i'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... anything we want."
10,15,chandler:, my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. 
10,15,ross:," all right, we'll work it out."
10,15,rachel:, thank you! thank you!

10,15,joey:," what? no, no, no! no, no... no... no, no... no, too much is changing, okay? first, phoebe getting married congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs..."
10,15,monica:," hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive..."
10,15,joey:," well, it comes and goes. i wouldn't trust it."
10,15,rachel:," look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. and it means a lot if you could try to get on board."
10,15,phoebe:, of course we can. congratulations. yay! joey...
10,15,joey:," no, no, no. my hugs are reserved for people staying in america."
10,15,rachel:," joey, it would mean so..."
10,15,joey:, hey! no! get your france going arms away from me. 
10,15,rachel:, joey...
10,15,phoebe:, you okay with this?
10,15,chandler:," well, it makes me feel sad, but..."
10,15,phoebe:, talking to ross.
10,15,chandler:, i see.
10,15,ross:," well, rachel moving to another country? not being able to see her every day. how can i be okay with this?"
10,15,monica:," i know, but what are we gonna do? she really needs this job."
10,15,ross:," do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?"
10,15,monica:, how is that gonna happen?
10,15,chandler:, is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
10,15,ross:, i don't know. i could talk to her boss. yeah! i met him at that christmas party. we really hit it off.
10,15,monica:, you mean the guy who kept calling you ron?
10,15,ross:, i didn't say we were brothers. opening credits 
10,15,monica:," hey phoebe. hey, tell me what you think. all right. the house next door to the one that we're buying in westchester? just went on the market. i wanna take a look at it, but chandler doesn't."
10,15,chandler:," we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. we're not very bright."
10,15,monica:, but what if it is better than ours? should we at least look?
10,15,chandler:, what do you think pheebs?
10,15,phoebe:," well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins... anyway... hey, isn't joey's agent estelle leonard?"
10,15,chandler:, yeah.
10,15,phoebe:, she died.
10,15,chandler:, you're kidding!
10,15,monica:, that's terrible!
10,15,phoebe:," yeah, last saturday. wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic. oh, wait a minute, i read the wrong one."
10,15,chandler:, oh yeah? 
10,15,phoebe:," yeah, she was just an agent."
10,15,monica:, joey's gonna be *so* upset. 
10,15,chandler:, i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic.
10,15,phoebe:," well, we cannot tell joey about this. he's already flipping out about everything that's changing. this will push him over the edge."
10,15,monica:," seriously, you don't think we should tell him?"
10,15,phoebe:," well, not for a little while. let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else."
10,15,monica:, what if he reads it in the paper?
10,15,chandler:, may i help you?
10,15,ross:," oh right, uhm, don?"
10,15,ross:, uh... what can i do for you?
10,15,ross:," ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?"
10,15,ross:," wow, that is tempting. "
10,15,ross:, she is good!
10,15,ross:," but i'm sorry. there's nothing i can do... ah, it's not true, there is... nothing i want to do."
10,15,ross:," yeah, his name is ross. what?"
10,15,ross:," yeah, they're all he talks about, why?"
10,15,ross:, you can really arrange that?
10,15,ross:," well, i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing in the world."
10,15,ross:," thats great. i worry about little ross. hes always reading, he's collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs."
10,15,ross:, hell be fine. 
10,15,joey:, hey phoebe.
10,15,phoebe:, hey. everything ok?
10,15,joey:, im just mad at my agent.
10,15,phoebe:, estelle? why?
10,15,joey:, theres a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didnt even be put up for it! shed better have a good reason.
10,15,phoebe:," well im wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this."
10,15,phoebe:," well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. all right, i gotta go. just listen. promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her."
10,15,joey:, ok. why?
10,15,phoebe:, because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. 
10,15,joey:, i love that saying! .
10,15,joey:," joey, its estelle."
10,15,joey:," its a little coincidental, but believable. . listen, im sure youre wondering why i didnt get you an audition for that tv movie."
10,15,joey:, i guess i dropped the ball there. whoopsie! 
10,15,joey:," dont take that tone with me. who you think you are? alan lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic?"
10,15,joey:, what are you saying?
10,15,joey:," im saying that¦ . this isn't working for me anymore, ok? estelle, youre fired. goodbye. ."
10,15,phoebe:," man, tough week for estelle!   "
10,15,ross:, hi.
10,15,rachel:, hi.
10,15,ross:, emma left her stuffed t rex at my house. you know she cant sleep without it.
10,15,rachel:," oh, well, shes asleep now. stop forcing that thing on her."
10,15,ross:, ok.
10,15,rachel:," oh, youre not gonna believe what happened to me today! ralph lauren called, and gave me my job back!"
10,15,ross:, nooo!
10,15,rachel:," yee. i mean, it was so weirdest thing. they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! i mean, that place must have been falling apart without me."
10,15,ross:," so, youre not going to paris."
10,15,rachel:," no, im still going."
10,15,ross:, wh¦ wh¦what?
10,15,rachel:," when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! isnt that great?"
10,15,ross:, yeeeah!   
10,15,monica:," hi. were buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around."
10,15,lady:," oh, sure. im showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around."
10,15,monica:, thanks.
10,15,chandler:," it feels like were cheating on our house. and if were gonna cheat, shouldnt it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house wont do?"
10,15,monica:," ours is so much better! this living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! what a hole!"
10,15,lady:, so? what do you think?
10,15,monica:, love it!
10,15,lady:," well, we already have one offer on it, and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one."
10,15,monica:," they could be our neighbors, what are they like?"
10,15,lady:," oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. she and her husband have two kids, he's on wall street and she¦"
10,15,janice:, sure. 
10,15,phoebe:," hey joey, want come with me to¦ are you ok?"
10,15,joey:," yeah, i just¦ i just feel bad about firing estelle. this is got to be killing her."
10,15,phoebe:," no, that wouldnt kill her. ordinary embolism might."
10,15,joey:," i dont know. shes got to be taking it hard, i was like her only client. except for this guy who eats paper. and im guessing he eats more money than he makes. look, i know shes not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. im gonna call her and hire her again."
10,15,phoebe:," no, no, no! don't call her! you wait for her to call you "
10,15,joey:, why?
10,15,phoebe:, because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
10,15,joey:, you blow me away. 
10,15,phoebe:," all right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?"
10,15,joey:," i promise. and that means, never having to give a reason.   "
10,15,janice:, what a small world!
10,15,chandler:, and yet i never run into beyonce!
10,15,realtor:, you two know each other?
10,15,janice:," oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man out of him, chandler used to be my little love muffin! . so? are you guys thinking of getting this house too? ooh! are we gonna have a bidding war? i'd better warn you, i'm a toughie "
10,15,chandler:," don't, don't! "
10,15,monica:," no, actually, we're buying the house next door. "
10,15,chandler:, why!?
10,15,monica:, i don't know why.
10,15,janice:," ooh, that decides it then. i was on the fence. but knowing that you two would be our neighbors? ah! now we have to get it! ellen, we're going to talk numbers. "
10,15,chandler:, this can not be happening!
10,15,monica:," okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. maybe the janice's won't get it! maybe the other couple will."
10,15,chandler:," the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the hitlers."
10,15,monica:," okay, okay, all right. what if we got both houses? huh? we can turn this house into a guest house."
10,15,chandler:," that is a great idea! and by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?"
10,15,monica:," okay, you come up with an idea."
10,15,chandler:," alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. we can still get out."
10,15,monica:, but we love our house.
10,15,chandler:," will we love it so much with her next door? and she's gonna be louder out here too. just the crickets and ""oh my god""! "
10,15,monica:," okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! i mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. i mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. "
10,15,chandler:, who is it?
10,15,ross:," this may surprise you, but re hiring fired employees, is not my main job."
10,15,ross:," not good, ron. "
10,15,ross:," wow, that's pretty cool "
10,15,ross:," okay, you got it."
10,15,ross:, this is gonna make me very popular.
10,15,ross:, i meant with my son.
10,15,ross:," joey, this is al t. booker, the guy who eats paper. i'm sure you've heard that estelle passed away. i wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. hope you can make it. "
10,15,joey:, oh my god. hello?
10,15,phoebe:," joey, it's estelle. "
10,15,joey:, estelle?
10,15,phoebe:," yeah, i wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me."
10,15,joey:," ok ay. i just, i can't believe you're calling me?"
10,15,phoebe:," well, i didn't think i should just drop by..."
10,15,joey:," no, no, no! don't drop by, don't drop by!"
10,15,phoebe:," anyway, you did what you had to do. i'm okay."
10,15,joey:," can i ask you something? uhm, what's it like there?"
10,15,phoebe:," it's alright. look kiddo, i gotta go. good luck with the career. you're gonna be huge."
10,15,joey:," thanks for everything estelle. bye. ""out of area"". boy, i'll say.   "
10,15,janice:," well... i just talked to sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a a and i'll bet we get it."
10,15,chandler:, the hitlers will be so disappointed.
10,15,janice:," all right, i got to run. tell monica i say goodbye. and... i'll see you later, neighbor. "
10,15,chandler:, wait! i just want you to know that... i'm so happy you're going to be here.
10,15,janice:," oh, me too... "
10,15,chandler:, because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
10,15,janice:, huh?
10,15,chandler:, i never stopped loving you.
10,15,janice:, oh... my...
10,15,chandler:," yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein."
10,15,janice:," chandler, what are you talking about?"
10,15,chandler:," now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and monica never have to know a thing."
10,15,janice:," i don't know what to say... i mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us."
10,15,chandler:, obviously.
10,15,janice:," but i love my husband. and i know you love your wife. now, i don't think we should get this house now."
10,15,chandler:, don't say that. don't tangle the dream and take it away.
10,15,janice:," chandler, one of us has got to be strong."
10,15,chandler:, i understand.
10,15,janice:," although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... goodbye chandler bing. "
10,15,chandler:, they're never coming down now.   
10,15,rachel:, hi!
10,15,ross:, hey!
10,15,rachel:, you are never going to believe what happened to me today.
10,15,ross:, what?
10,15,rachel:, ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money.
10,15,ross:, they did?
10,15,rachel:, yeah. it was the weirdest thing. zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. and that i should thank some ron... i don't even know what department that guy's in.
10,15,ross:," so, what are you gonna do?"

"
10,15,ross:," uhm, i hadn't no you... i had no idea you were so excited about paris. uhm, i mean, you said you were scared."
10,15,rachel:," well yeah, but i mean, it was good scared though, you know? like when i moved to new york scared. or uhm, when i found out i was gonna have emma scared... but this is... fine. this is gonna be good. "

10,16,phoebe:," yes! you know, in six months the statute of limitations runs out and i can travel internationally again!"
10,16,rachel:, i'm gonna miss you so much.
10,16,phoebe:, i know.
10,16,rachel:," you know what? uhm, i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say to each of you and i was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here ."
10,16,ross:," hey, what do you think they're doing in there?"
10,16,joey:," huh, if i had to guess i'd say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching.   "
10,16,rachel:," oh, pheebs, i don't even know where to start."
10,16,phoebe:," ok well, before you do, i know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but i do have something for you."
10,16,rachel:," oh, oh. . what is this?"
10,16,phoebe:," it's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the dna to create your own pheebs!"
10,16,rachel:," i'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!   "
10,16,monica:, chandler? i was just in our bedroom and i found these on my pillow.
10,16,chandler:," oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play! "
10,16,monica:, what are you talking about? these aren't mine.
10,16,chandler:," oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from me!"
10,16,monica:," that would be a terrible punishment. but, i'm serious, i've never seen these before."
10,16,chandler:, really? then what are they doing in our guestroom?
10,16,monica:, rachel used to live in that room.
10,16,chandler:, rachel... with handcuffs! interesting! 
10,16,monica:, joey's bare ass!
10,16,chandler:, . well played. 
10,16,rachel:, i love you phoebe.
10,16,phoebe:, i love you too. please don't... don't turn into... you know... french bitch! 
10,16,rachel:," all right. well, if i gonna do this, i'd better keep going."
10,16,phoebe:, ok.
10,16,rachel:, ok. monica?
10,16,monica:, yeah?
10,16,rachel:, can you come here with me for a minute?
10,16,monica:, sure.
10,16,phoebe:, are you wearing waterproof mascara?
10,16,monica:, no.
10,16,phoebe:," oh, you're so screwed. "
10,16,ross:, hey. what was that all about?
10,16,phoebe:, she's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
10,16,ross:, are you kidding? oh my god...
10,16,phoebe:," yeah, i know, it's gonna be even worse for you... god... ross, get ready to do some serious crying."
10,16,ross:," oh, man, i'm not going to be able to handle this. now i know how my students feel at the end of each year. and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.   "
10,16,rachel:," mon... okay... i've gotta... just say what it is i'm gonna say... none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. no one has been more like a sister to me..."
10,16,monica:, i know what you mean. you're like a sister to me too. 
10,16,rachel:, i wouldn't know what i'm gonna do without you... 
10,16,monica:, you're the best friend i ever had.
10,16,rachel:, 
10,16,monica:, what? 
10,16,rachel:, i... i... i... 
10,16,monica:, that is so sweet.   
10,16,ross:," oh no, she took down monica... and i'm the crier in the family. oh god! i could be next. maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. oh, so that thing you said about the thing. it really made me think about that other thing."
10,16,chandler:," uh, rach?"
10,16,ross:, well it's okay. chandler is talking to her. 
10,16,joey:, i really made you think about that thing uh?
10,16,chandler:," uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you. "
10,16,rachel:," oh, i'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don't get."
10,16,chandler:," no, no, no... they're really yours. we... found them in your old room."
10,16,rachel:," well, these aren't mine. maybe monica used to use them with..."
10,16,chandler:," don't say richard! well, if they're not monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?"
10,16,rachel:," well, i think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room."
10,16,chandler:, pheebs!
10,16,phoebe:, yeah!
10,16,chandler:, i think these are yours.
10,16,phoebe:," these are not mine... look how flimsy they are, come on! good god! you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice."
10,16,rachel:, can i talk to you alone for a minute?
10,16,chandler:, sure. you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
10,16,phoebe:, where do you think mike really is?   
10,16,rachel:, oh honey... 
10,16,chandler:," let me just say something... because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you. and i'm so sad that you're leaving."
10,16,rachel:," oh, you know what? let's not say anything else. i love you. "
10,16,chandler:," ooh, not so tight... i'm sorry, just give me one more chance."
10,16,rachel:, okay. oh... 
10,16,rachel:, oh!
10,16,chandler:," i'm sor... just go. just go. i can't, i can't.   "
10,16,monica:," so, i guess you're next. you're ready?"
10,16,ross:, i don't think so. 
10,16,chandler:," oh, you're definately not. i haven't cried like that in years."
10,16,monica:, you cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
10,16,chandler:, that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. 
10,16,ross:, god! i can't believe she saved me for last. why are they taking so long? 
10,16,phoebe:," i don't know. but, god, joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well. "
10,16,all:," no, no, no, no! "
10,16,ross:," okay, here we go..."
10,16,rachel:, oh... well...
10,16,ross:, yeah...
10,16,rachel:, i think i'm gonna take off. 
10,16,ross:, huh?
10,16,rachel:," oh, you guys. this was an amazing night. thank you so much. i love you. good night. "
10,16,ross:, what? i don't get a goodbye? 
10,16,joey:, lucky bastard!   
10,16,ross:, unbelievable. she says goodbye to everyone but me.
10,16,monica:," well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit."
10,16,ross:," well, it needs to be plicit."
10,16,joey:," all right, let's think about this. i mean, there's got to be an explanation. uh... did you do anything to make her mad? "
10,16,ross:," no, i don't think so."
10,16,phoebe:," you know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. it was pretty intense."
10,16,monica:, yeah. mine too.
10,16,chandler:, mine was a humdinger 
10,16,ross:," o kay... i mean, don't i deserve anything? i mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? not from you! "
10,16,phoebe:," ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her."
10,16,monica:," and say what? ""you owe me a goodbye"", i mean, he's got more pride than that."
10,16,ross:, the hell i do! 
10,16,ross:, i don't get a goodbye?
10,16,rachel:, what?
10,16,ross:," everyone gets a goodbye but me? what have i got to do to get a goodbye, huh? be best friends with you? uh, go out with you? have a baby with you? oh wait a minute, wait a minute, i did all those things."
10,16,rachel:, ross...
10,16,ross:," oh no, maybe it's me, i'm just not giving you enough credit. uh, i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... it's physically impossible. you know what? after all we've been through, i can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. have a, have a good time in paris.   "
10,16,monica:, i hope ross isn't too upset.
10,16,joey:, i'm sure he's not more bummed out than i am.
10,16,phoebe:, tell me about it.
10,16,chandler:," well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
10,16,phoebe:," all right, i think i'm gonna head out."
10,16,monica:," uh, where do you think you're going?"
10,16,phoebe:," i thought i was going home to go to bed, but i'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here."
10,16,monica:, we're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. it would be great if you guys could pitch in.
10,16,chandler:, joey and i can finish up in the guest room.
10,16,joey:," oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. "
10,16,monica:, oh no! you and phoebe are gonna help me in here.
10,16,chandler:, you couldn't be cool. 
10,16,monica:, yeah.
10,16,monica:," good! now i need you to be careful and efficient. and remember, if i am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong."
10,16,chandler:," hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are."
10,16,monica:, you did? how?
10,16,chandler:," well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used."
10,16,monica:, oh my god! let me see. 
10,16,joey:, who's that dirty old lady?
10,16,chandler:, monica's grandmother.
10,16,monica:, nana liked it rough! 
10,16,erica:, hi!
10,16,all:, hey!
10,16,joey:," come on here, have a seat."
10,16,phoebe:, how was your night?
10,16,erica:," oh, it was okay. i went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. we went to this place that had... ooh... hoo... ooh... anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers."
10,16,monica:," erica, are you okay?"
10,16,erica:," yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these stomach aches. they come and go like every few minutes."
10,16,monica:, oh my god!
10,16,chandler:, relax! we just get her some antacids.
10,16,monica:," she doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor."
10,16,chandler:, oh my god!
10,16,phoebe:," yeah, you got to get to the hospital."
10,16,monica:," all right, chandler get the coats. erica let's go. phoebe and joey, keep packing! oh my god we're gonna have a baby. all right. we're gonna have a baby! oh my god, we're gonna have a baby! oh god, oh god, i got to sit down, i got to sit down. ooh! "
10,16,chandler:," honey, it's gonna be okay."
10,16,erica:, you can do this. just breathe.
10,16,monica:," okay, okay... okay, i feel a little better."
10,16,erica:, ooh! are you sure?
10,16,monica:," oh... yes, i'm sure. oh honey, let's go. okay bye everyone. "
10,16,joey:," chandler, wait, wait, wait..."
10,16,chandler:, what?
10,16,joey:," if you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.   "
10,16,rachel:, you really think i didn't say goodbye to you because i don't care?
10,16,ross:, that's what it seemed like.
10,16,rachel:," i cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know one thing about me."
10,16,ross:," fine, then why didn't you say something?"
10,16,rachel:," because it is too damn hard ross. i can't even begin to explain to you how much i'm gonna miss you. when i think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... okay, so if you think that i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. it's because you mean more to me. so there, all right, there's your goodbye... oh!"
10,16,ross:, rach!
10,16,rachel:, what?
10,16,ross:," you keep, you keep... you can't..."
10,16,rachel:, what?   commercial break

10,16,phoebe:, okay. 
10,16,joey:," a little more, a little more. a little more... all right. okay, all right, let's do this."
10,16,phoebe:," all right, ready?"
10,16,joey:," yeah. all right, now give me your best shot."
10,16,phoebe:," all right, here it goes... "
10,16,joey:, doesn't work... 
10,17,monica:," erica, are you okay?"
10,17,erica:," yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these stomach aches. they come and go like every few minutes."
10,17,monica:, oh my god!
10,17,chandler:, relax! we'll just get her some antacids.
10,17,monica:, she doesn't have a stomach ache. she's in labor!
10,17,chandler:, oh my god!   
10,17,rachel:," so if you think i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. it's because you mean more to me."
10,17,ross:, rach!
10,17,rachel:, what?!   
10,17,ross:, hey.
10,17,rachel:, shh.. go back to sleep. i have to go home.
10,17,ross:, oh. this was amazing.
10,17,rachel:, it really was. you've learned some new moves!
10,17,ross:," yeah, well, this guy at work gave me ""sex for dummies"" as a joke."
10,17,rachel:, ah.
10,17,ross:, who's laughing now?
10,17,rachel:, i know!   opening credits 
10,17,monica:," breathe, breathe, breathe... good."
10,17,chandler:," next time, can i say breathe?"
10,17,monica:," no, last time you said it like dracula, and it scared her! can i get you anything? you want some more ice chips?"
10,17,erica:," no, i'm okay."
10,17,monica:," alright, i'll be right back."
10,17,chandler:, where are you going?
10,17,monica:, to use the bathroom.
10,17,chandler:, you can't leave me alone with her.
10,17,monica:, what?
10,17,chandler:, this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with!
10,17,monica:, what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
10,17,chandler:," it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together."
10,17,monica:," you'll be fine. nah, you won't, but i'll be back in two minutes."
10,17,chandler:, okay. 
10,17,chandler:," so, ah... any plans for the summer?"
10,17,erica:, i don't know. maybe church camp?
10,17,chandler:," hah. may not wanna mention this. so, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?"
10,17,erica:, what?
10,17,chandler:," well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both. "
10,17,chandler:," one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who knows? maybe there's something even more painful than those things? like this.   "
10,17,phoebe:, morning.
10,17,joey:, hey!
10,17,phoebe:, what's that?
10,17,joey:, it's my house warming present for monica and chandler.
10,17,phoebe:, it's a baby chick and duck!
10,17,joey:, uh huh. and i named them chick jr. and duck jr.
10,17,phoebe:, i did not see that coming.
10,17,joey:," yeah, i figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? it has that big backyard. and then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to."
10,17,phoebe:, yes.
10,17,joey:, yeah. it's a shame people can't visit there.
10,17,phoebe:," that is the rule, though. "
10,17,phoebe:, guess what? you're almost an uncle!
10,17,ross:, what?
10,17,joey:," yeah, erica went into labor last night. monica and chandler are at the hospital right now!"
10,17,ross:, oh my god!
10,17,phoebe:," yeah, and i have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl."
10,17,ross:," phoebe, you were sure ben was gonna be a girl."
10,17,phoebe:, have you seen him throw a ball?
10,17,ross:, is rachel here?
10,17,joey:," uh, i think she's still asleep. hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? she seemed pretty pissed at you."
10,17,ross:," uh, we, y'know, we worked things out."
10,17,phoebe:, what's that smile? did something happen with you two?
10,17,ross:," hey, i'm not one to kiss and tell, but i'm also not one to have sex and shut up. we totally did it!"
10,17,joey:, oh my god. you and rachel?
10,17,ross:," i know, it's pretty great."
10,17,joey:, so what does that mean? are you guys getting back together?
10,17,ross:," oh, i.. i don't know. we didn't really get to talk."
10,17,phoebe:, but do you wanna get back together?
10,17,ross:," i don't know. it was incredible. i mean, it just felt so right. when i was holding her, i mean, i never wanted to let her go. you know what? yeah, i do. i wanna be together."
10,17,phoebe:, yay!
10,17,ross:, shhh!
10,17,phoebe:, yay!
10,17,joey:," so, so is she still going to paris?"
10,17,ross:," wow, i hadn't thought of that. i hope not."
10,17,phoebe:," oh, this is like the best day ever. ever! you guys might get back together, monica and chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! oh, i feel like i'm in a musical! ""daa raa... when the sun comes up, bright and beaming! and the moon comes..."" "
10,17,rachel:, morning!
10,17,phoebe:, guess we'll never know how it ends.

10,17,rachel:, chick and the duck? didn't they die...
10,17,phoebe:," dive. yeah, they dove head first into fun on the farm. "
10,17,ross:, so...

10,17,ross:, it really was.
10,17,rachel:, i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
10,17,ross:," i know, me too. it was... you know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be."
10,17,rachel:," uh huh. i know. it was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.   "
10,17,monica:," it's just a little bit more, honey."
10,17,erica:, help me! this hurts!
10,17,chandler:, is it really that bad?
10,17,erica:, uh huh! i think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse! 
10,17,doctor:, the baby's head is crowning. 
10,17,monica:," oh! oh my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen! chandler, you have to see this! "
10,17,chandler:, i'm okay.
10,17,monica:," chandler, you don't wanna miss this. this is the birth of your child! it's the miracle of life!"
10,17,chandler:," alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle."
10,17,doctor:, start pushing. here we go. here come the shoulders... 
10,17,monica:, it's a... it's a boy!
10,17,chandler:, wow!
10,17,erica:, is he okay?
10,17,doctor:, he's just fine.
10,17,monica:," oh, you did it!"
10,17,chandler:, it's a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some other stuff i'm gonna pretend i don't see.
10,17,doctor:, would you like to cut the umbilical cord? 
10,17,chandler:," well, that's spongy."
10,17,monica:," oh, hey handsome! oh, i'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! oh, we are so lucky!"
10,17,chandler:, i know. he has your eyes. 
10,17,chandler:," i mean, i know that's not possible, but he does."
10,17,nurse:, we'll just get him cleaned up a bit. 
10,17,chandler:, okay.
10,17,monica:," oh my god, he's beautiful. thank you so much."
10,17,erica:, i'm really happy for you guys.
10,17,chandler:, how do you feel?
10,17,erica:, i'm tired!
10,17,doctor:," well, you don't have that much time to relax. the other one will be along in a minute. "
10,17,monica:," i... i'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?"
10,17,doctor:, the next baby should be along in a minute.
10,17,monica:, we only ordered one!
10,17,doctor:," you know it's twins, right?"
10,17,chandler:," oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know! commercial break "
10,17,doctor:, i can't believe you didn't know it's twins! this has never happened before.
10,17,chandler:," well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good."
10,17,monica:," wait, did you know it was twins?"
10,17,doctor:," yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio."
10,17,monica:, anybody tell you?
10,17,erica:," i don't think so. although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. but i thought that was just mine and the baby's. they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and i thought well, that's good 'cause i'm having a baby."
10,17,monica:, this is unbelievable.
10,17,erica:, twins actually run in my family.
10,17,chandler:, interesting! can i see you for a second? 
10,17,chandler:, what do we do?
10,17,monica:," what do you mean ""what do we do""?"
10,17,chandler:, twins! twins!!
10,17,monica:," chandler, you're panicking!"
10,17,chandler:," uh huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?"
10,17,monica:, we can't split them up!
10,17,chandler:," why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. i mean, that's a great day for everybody."
10,17,monica:," okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?"
10,17,chandler:, what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king?
10,17,monica:," yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt."
10,17,chandler:," monica, we are not ready to have two babies!"
10,17,monica:," that doesn't matter! we have waited so long for this. i don't care if it's two babies. i don't care if it's three babies! i don't care if the entire cast of ""eight is enough"" comes out of there! we are taking them home, because they are our children!"
10,17,chandler:, okay. shhh... 
10,17,chandler:, okay.
10,17,monica:, okay!
10,17,chandler:, okay!
10,17,doctor:, it looks like we're about ready over here. 
10,17,doctor:," come on, erica, start pushing again now."
10,17,erica:, ow! 
10,17,doctor:, here she comes!
10,17,chandler:, she? it's a girl?
10,17,doctor:, yeah.
10,17,chandler:," well, now we have one of each! and that's enough!   "
10,17,ross:, and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
10,17,joey:, oh my god! what did you say?
10,17,ross:, nothing! what do you say to that?
10,17,phoebe:," ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!"
10,17,ross:, no way!
10,17,joey:, you can't just give up! is that what a dinosaur would do?
10,17,ross:, what?
10,17,joey:," dude, i'm just trying to speak your language."
10,17,phoebe:," ross, rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. if she did, she might feel differently. she might not even go."
10,17,ross:, you really think so?
10,17,phoebe:," i'm telling you! oh, okay! this is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. ""bam bam, don't take no for an answer. bam bam, don't let love fly away. bam bam bam bam..."" "
10,17,rachel:, hi!
10,17,phoebe:, can't a girl finish a song around here?
10,17,joey:, hey!
10,17,rachel:, hi! so i just dropped emma off at my mom's.
10,17,ross:, okay.
10,17,joey:," oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?"
10,17,rachel:," no, we decided that i would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday."
10,17,phoebe:," wow, eight hour flight with a one year old? good luck, mom."
10,17,rachel:," are you kidding? eight hours with my mother talking about atkins? good luck, emma! "
10,17,ross:," alright, you know what? you're right. i should at least tell her how i feel. "
10,17,joey:," ross, wait!"
10,17,ross:, what? what?
10,17,joey:, could you get me a muffin? 
10,17,gunther:, rachel?
10,17,rachel:, yeah?
10,17,gunther:," i... i know you're leaving tonight, but i just have to tell you. i love you. "
10,17,gunther:," i... i don't know if that changes your plans at all, but i thought you should know."
10,17,rachel:," gunther... oh... i love you too. probably not in the same way, but i do. and, and when i'm in a cafÃ©, having coffee, or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun, i'll think of you. aw. "
10,17,rachel:, oh... bye guys. 
10,17,ross:, oh my god!
10,17,phoebe:, unbelievable!
10,17,joey:," hey, you know what might help?"
10,17,ross:, i'm not getting you a muffin!   
10,17,monica:, do you think they recognize each other from in there?
10,17,chandler:," maybe. unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet."
10,17,nurse:, we're going to take erica to recovery now.
10,17,monica:, there's something that we wanna tell you. we decided to name the girl baby erica.
10,17,erica:," oh my god, that's just like my name!"
10,17,monica:," son of a gun, it is!"
10,17,erica:," anyway, i'm gonna go and get some rest. i'm really glad i picked you guys. you're gonna make great parents. even chandler."
10,17,monica:," okay, well, bye!"
10,17,erica:, bye!
10,17,chandler:, bye!
10,17,monica:, we'll call you!
10,17,erica:, okay.
10,17,chandler:, have fun at church camp! 
10,17,monica:," oh, look at these little bunnies!"
10,17,chandler:, i know! you ready to trade?
10,17,monica:, okay.
10,17,chandler:, okay.
10,17,monica:," alright, let's see.. "
10,17,chandler:, we could trade later.
10,17,monica:," yeah, i'm good.   "
10,17,phoebe:," hey, what are you working on?"
10,17,joey:," it's a... it's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby. "
10,17,phoebe:," how sweet! oh, is that the baby? "
10,17,joey:," no, i sat in the paint. "
10,17,ross:, hey.
10,17,phoebe:," hey. so, did you talk to rachel?"
10,17,ross:," no, and i'm not going to."
10,17,phoebe:, what?
10,17,joey:, why not?
10,17,ross:, because she's just going to shoot me down. you guys saw what happened with gunther. that did not look like fun.
10,17,phoebe:," how can you compare yourself to gunther? i mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. you have a relationship with her, you slept together last night."
10,17,ross:," yeah, and she still wants to go! it's pretty clear where she is."
10,17,joey:," yeah, i know what you mean. i mean, sometimes... "
10,17,phoebe:," uh, joe?"
10,17,joey:, damn it!
10,17,ross:," look, even if i were gonna tell her, i don't have to do it now. okay? i'll be seeing her again. we've got time."
10,17,phoebe:," no, you don't! she's going to paris! she is going to meet somebody. do you know how many hot guys there are in paris? it's... it's a city of gunthers! "
10,17,mike:, hey!
10,17,phoebe:, hey! what do you have there?
10,17,mike:," oh, i made a little something. if i had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but.. "
10,17,ross:, oh my god! you did that yourself?
10,17,phoebe:," honey, that's gorgeous!"
10,17,joey:," you know, the baby can't read, mike! "
10,17,rachel:," hi! you guys, the car service just got here. i can't believe they're not home yet! i have to catch my stupid plane. i wanna see the baby!"
10,17,joey:," monica just called from the cab. she said they should be here any minute. and apparently, there's some big surprise."
10,17,phoebe:," yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'cause my friend ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard. "
10,17,rachel:, oh my god!
10,17,ross:, oh my god! 
10,17,rachel:, hi! oh my gosh! 
10,17,chandler:, hey. 
10,17,joey:," hey, so what is the big surprise?"
10,17,rachel:, oh. 
10,17,ross:, oh my god!
10,17,rachel:, what... what...
10,17,ross:," okay, okay, awkward question. the hospital knows you took two, right?"
10,17,monica:," yes, it's twins!"
10,17,ross:, oh my god.
10,17,joey:," oh, they're so cute! now, what, what kinds are they?"
10,17,monica:," this is a boy, and that's a girl."
10,17,chandler:, her name is erica.
10,17,rachel:, aw..
10,17,joey:," hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica."
10,17,chandler:, yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
10,17,monica:," yeah, we named the boy jack after dad."
10,17,ross:," aw, he's gonna be so happy."
10,17,phoebe:," oh, jack bing. i love that. ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? ""jack bing, morning gazette. i'm gonna blow this story wide open!"" "
10,17,rachel:," oh my gosh. wow, so beautiful."
10,17,mike:, i want one.
10,17,phoebe:," oh yeah? well, tell me which one, and i'll try slip it in my coat."
10,17,mike:, seriously. wanna make one of those?
10,17,phoebe:, one? how about a whole bunch?
10,17,mike:, really?
10,17,phoebe:," yeah! ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the von trapp family! only without the nazis. although that sounds kinda dull."
10,17,rachel:," oh, you guys, i can't believe this. but i'll leave now, or i'm gonna miss my plane."
10,17,monica:, i'm just so glad you got to see the babies. 
10,17,rachel:," me too. oh, i'm just sorry i'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! alright, i can't say goodbye to you guys again. i love you all so much."
10,17,monica:, i love you.
10,17,chandler:, i love you.
10,17,monica:, call us when you get there.
10,17,rachel:," i will. ross, come here. "
10,17,rachel:, i just want you to know.. last night.. i'll never forget it.
10,17,ross:, neither will i. 
10,17,rachel:," alright, now i really have to go. okay. au revoir! oh, they're gonna really hate me over there. "
10,17,phoebe:," so, you just let her go?"
10,17,ross:, yeah.
10,17,joey:," hey, maybe that's for the best."
10,17,ross:, yeah?
10,17,joey:," yeah. you know? you just... look, you gotta... you gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?"
10,17,phoebe:, but now she'll never know how he feels!
10,17,joey:," maybe that's okay. you know? maybe, maybe it is better this way? i mean, now, now you can move on. i mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. right? "
10,17,joey:, maybe now you can actually do it. you know? you can finally get over her.
10,17,ross:," yeah, that's true. except i don't wanna get over her."
10,17,joey:, what?
10,17,ross:, i don't! i wanna be with her.
10,17,joey:, really?
10,17,ross:," yeah, i'm gonna go after her."
10,17,joey:," yeah, you are!"
10,17,phoebe:, woo! 
10,17,phoebe:," wait, wait! get your coat! get your coat!"
10,17,ross:, my coat...
10,17,joey:, this is so cool!
10,17,chandler:," i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited!"
10,17,joey:," but ross, ross. what do you, what do you think she's going to say?"
10,17,ross:," i don't know, but i.. look, even if she shoots me down, at least i won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. where where is my coat?!"
10,17,phoebe:," you didn't bring one! my cab's downstairs, i'll drive you to the airport."
10,17,ross:," okay, guys, wish me luck."
10,17,phoebe:, hurry!
10,17,joey:," good luck, good luck!   "
10,17,ross:, there's no seatbelt!
10,17,phoebe:," that's okay. if if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car. "
10,17,ross:," alright, alright, let's do this!"
10,17,phoebe:, okay! 
10,17,ross:, hey!
10,17,man:, 18th and east end.
10,17,phoebe:, i i don't take passengers.
10,17,man:, hey! the law says you have to accept any fare.
10,17,ross:," no, you don't understand. this isn't a real cab."
10,17,man:," alright, i gotta report you. what's your medallion number?"
10,17,phoebe:," my medallion number is, ""get out of the cab!"""
10,17,man:, what?
10,17,ross:, get out of the cab!
10,17,phoebe:, get out of the cab!   
10,17,joey:," oh, hey, hey, can i give you guys your house warming present now?"
10,17,monica:," now, that you can do."
10,17,joey:, alright! 
10,17,joey:, ah... chick jr.? duck jr.? don't hide from mama!   
10,17,phoebe:, you can open your eyes now.
10,17,ross:, are we off the bridge?
10,17,phoebe:, yes.
10,17,ross:, is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
10,17,phoebe:," yes, she jumped right back up. "
10,17,ross:," oh my god, phoebe, slow down!"
10,17,phoebe:, do you wanna get to rachel in time?
10,17,ross:," yes, but i don't wanna die in your cab!"
10,17,phoebe:, you should have thought of that before you got in! 
10,17,phoebe:, toll booth.
10,17,ross:, what?
10,17,phoebe:, toll booth! four bucks. there are quarters in the glove compartment. 
10,17,phoebe:, hurry!
10,17,ross:, okay!

10,17,phoebe:," damn, that window is clean.   "
10,17,joey:," quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack... "
10,17,chandler:," we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this."
10,17,joey:," okay, i wanted to surprise you, but for your house warming gift, i got you a baby chick and a baby duck! "
10,17,chandler:, really? you got us a chick and a duck?
10,17,monica:," oh, great! just what you want for a new house with infants. bird feces."
10,17,joey:," yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!"
10,17,chandler:," oh, don't worry, we'll find them."
10,17,monica:," actually, i'm gonna go check on the twins."
10,17,chandler:, alright. 
10,17,monica:, oh god! what did i just step on?
10,17,joey:, oh!
10,17,chandler:," it's okay, it's just an egg roll."
10,17,monica:, oh..
10,17,joey:, you stepped on my egg roll?
10,17,monica:," i'm sorry, i didn't know to look for chinese food on the floor."
10,17,joey:, just put it on a plate and leave. 
10,17,chandler:," okay, let's find these birds."
10,17,joey:, alright. 
10,17,joey:," wait, wait. do you hear that? "
10,17,joey:, oh! they're in the table!
10,17,chandler:," well, that can't be good!"
10,17,joey:, we gotta get them out of there!
10,17,chandler:, how?
10,17,joey:," oh, oh! maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls?"
10,17,chandler:," oh, tons, i'm quite the woodsman."
10,17,joey:," well, maybe we can just tip the table a little."
10,17,chandler:," joey, wait! the ball!"
10,17,joey:, oh! 
10,17,joey:, oh god! so what do we do?
10,17,chandler:, i don't know. maybe we can open this up somehow.
10,17,joey:, okay.
10,17,chandler:, no... it's all glued together.
10,17,joey:, does that mean we have to bust it open?
10,17,chandler:, i don't know. maybe.
10,17,joey:, oh my god!
10,17,chandler:, i know! it's.. it's the foosball table.
10,17,joey:," all right, you know what? we don't have a choice. it's like i would have said in that sci fi movie if i'd gotten the part. ""those are our men in there, we have to get them out! even if i have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time machine."""
10,17,chandler:, did that movie ever get made?
10,17,joey:, it did not.   
10,17,phoebe:," ross, where are you going?"
10,17,ross:," to talk to rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death cab?"
10,17,phoebe:, what? what are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
10,17,ross:, not since my cop show got cancelled.
10,17,phoebe:, you have to get a ticket to get past security.
10,17,ross:, what? we're never gonna make it!
10,17,phoebe:," not with that attitude! now, haul ass! "
10,17,ross:," madame, your passport please?"
10,17,rachel:," your boarding pass, please."
10,17,rachel:, oh. 
10,17,rachel:," madame, if you don't have your boarding pass..."
10,17,rachel:," madame, you must have your boarding pass.."
10,17,rachel:," okay, fine! but you know what? if i was in 36d, we would not be having this problem.   "
10,17,ross:," hey, i need a ticket."
10,17,phoebe:," just one? i drive you all the way down here, and i don't get to see how it works out?"
10,17,ross:," fine, two tickets, i need two tickets."
10,17,phoebe:, and the destination?
10,17,ross:, i don't care. whatever is the cheapest.
10,17,phoebe:, i'm so lucky i married you.   
10,17,rachel:, oh! shoot! damn it! where is it? oh! oh! i found it! i found it! 
10,17,rachel:, hah! i found it! i told you i would find it! in your face! you're a different person.   
10,17,ross:," okay, flight 421 to paris. i don't see it, do you see it?"
10,17,phoebe:," no, did we miss it?"
10,17,ross:," no, no, no. that's impossible. it doesn't leave for another 20 minutes."
10,17,phoebe:, maybe we have the flight number wrong. god. 
10,17,monica:, hello.
10,17,phoebe:," hey, it's me. here's ross."
10,17,ross:," what? hey, hey, listen.. "
10,17,monica:," oh my god! ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. listen. "
10,17,ross:," monica? monica, monica, monica, monica..?"
10,17,monica:," oh, i'm sorry. shoot, they were doing it before."
10,17,ross:," that's alright. listen, listen."
10,17,monica:," oh, wait, wait, wait! here they go again. "
10,17,ross:," monica? monica, monica, monica, monica..?"
10,17,monica:, isn't that cute?
10,17,ross:, that is precious! listen! i need rachel's flight information.
10,17,monica:," oh, okay. alright, it's flight 421. leaves at 8 ."
10,17,ross:," yes, that's what i have. it's not on the board."
10,17,monica:," that's what it says here. flight 421, leaves at 8 , newark airport."
10,17,ross:, what?
10,17,monica:," newark airport. why, where are you?"
10,17,ross:, jfk.   
10,17,joey:," don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there."
10,17,chandler:," and we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing aids. "
10,17,joey:, okay. here goes.
10,17,chandler:, what's the matter?
10,17,joey:, i need to say goodbye to the table first.
10,17,chandler:, i understand.
10,17,joey:," okay. table, you have given us so many great times. and you guys, jordan, victor, joel... all of you guys. what can i say? you guys make us look good. you wanna say anything?"
10,17,chandler:," i don't know. except that, for one last time... good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game."
10,17,joey:," okay, here we go. i can't do it."
10,17,chandler:," well, i can't do it either. "
10,17,monica:, hey! did you find them?
10,17,joey:," yeah, they're stuck inside the table!"
10,17,chandler:," we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!"
10,17,monica:," oh, well sure. this gotta be so hard. i'll do it. gimme!   "
10,17,ross:," phoebe! wow! no, no, no! "
10,17,phoebe:," well, i've never gone this fast before."
10,17,ross:," phoebe, forget it, okay? newark is is like an hour away. there's no way we're gonna make it in time."
10,17,phoebe:," she's got her cell, you could call her."
10,17,ross:, i am not doing this over the phone.
10,17,phoebe:, you don't have any other choice! 
10,17,rachel:, hello?
10,17,phoebe:," rachel? oh, good. hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?"
10,17,rachel:, yeah.
10,17,phoebe:," for what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport."
10,17,ross:, yay.
10,17,phoebe:," uh, rach, hang on. "
10,17,rachel:, phoebe? is everything okay?
10,17,phoebe:," uhm, actually no. no, you've... you have to get off the plane."
10,17,rachel:, what? why?
10,17,phoebe:, i have this feeling that something's wrong with it. something is wrong with the left philange.
10,17,rachel:," oh, honey, i'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane. "
10,17,rachel:," uhm, what was that?"
10,17,rachel:," okay, that doesn't sound good."
10,17,rachel:, but she is sometimes.
10,17,rachel:, well... 
10,17,rachel:," i have to get off this plane, okay? her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left philange."
10,17,rachel:, we're all getting off. there is no philange! 
10,17,rachel:, this is ridiculous! i... 
10,17,rachel:," yeah, okay.   "
10,17,monica:, alright. my job here is done.
10,17,chandler:, that was... impressive.
10,17,joey:," yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!"
10,17,monica:," yeah, they were just slowing me down. alright, i have to get back to the babies. i'll see you girls later. "
10,17,chandler:," sorry about the table, man."
10,17,joey:, yeah.
10,17,chandler:, you gonna buy a new one?
10,17,joey:, probably not. nah. i don't know how much i'm gonna wanna play after you go.
10,17,chandler:," well, at least we got these little guys out."
10,17,joey:, yeah.
10,17,chandler:," aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?"
10,17,joey:, i'm gonna miss these little guys. it was nice having birds around again.
10,17,chandler:," hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you."
10,17,joey:, what?
10,17,chandler:," yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus, here they'd have their own room."
10,17,joey:, i could get a goose!
10,17,chandler:," you know, i i think you're set with the poultry."
10,17,joey:," thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you're gonna get to stay here! and, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit."
10,17,chandler:," i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?"
10,17,joey:," yes, the philange is fixed. as a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra philanges onboard, just in case. "
10,17,ross:, where is she?
10,17,phoebe:, i don't see her.
10,17,ross:, rachel! rachel green!
10,17,phoebe:, there she is!
10,17,ross:," wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?"
10,17,ross:," i'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass."
10,17,ross:," no, no, no, but..."
10,17,phoebe:, rachel!! 
10,17,rachel:, oh my god... what.. what are you guys doing here?
10,17,phoebe:," okay, you're on."
10,17,rachel:," what? what? ross, you're scaring me. what's going on?"
10,17,ross:," okay, the thing is.."
10,17,rachel:, yeah?
10,17,ross:, don't go.
10,17,rachel:, what?
10,17,ross:," please, please stay with me. i am so in love with you. please, don't go."
10,17,rachel:, oh my god.
10,17,ross:, miss? are you boarding the plane?

10,17,rachel:," ross, hi. it's me. i just got back on the plane. and i just feel awful. that is so not how i wanted things to end with us. it's just that i wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... and... and now i'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have said, and i didn't. i mean, i didn't even get to tell you that i love you too. because of course i do. i love you. i love you. i love you. what am i doing? i love you! oh, i've gotta see you. i've gotta get off this plane."
10,17,ross:, oh my god!
10,17,rachel:," miss? please, sit down!"
10,17,rachel:," miss, i can't let you off the plane."
10,17,ross:, i am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
10,17,rachel:," oh, please, miss, you don't understand!"
10,17,ross:, try to understand!
10,17,rachel:," oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off... "
10,17,ross:, no! no! oh my god. did she get off the plane? did she get off the plane?
10,17,rachel:, i got off the plane.
10,17,ross:, you got off the plane. 
10,17,rachel:, i do love you.
10,17,ross:," i love you too, and i'm never letting you go again."
10,17,rachel:," okay. 'cause this is where i wanna be, okay? no more messing around. i don't wanna mess this up again."
10,17,ross:," me neither, okay? we are we're done being stupid."
10,17,rachel:," okay. you and me, alright? this is it."
10,17,ross:, this is it. unless we're on a break. 
10,17,ross:, don't make jokes now.   
10,17,monica:," okay, please be careful with that. it was my grandmother's. be careful. "
10,17,monica:," if that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing. "
10,17,ross:, wow.
10,17,rachel:, i know. it seems smaller somehow.
10,17,joey:, has it always been purple?
10,17,chandler:," look around, you guys. this was your first home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal! "
10,17,phoebe:," hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?"
10,17,monica:," oh, yeah, that's true."
10,17,ross:," uh, i haven't."
10,17,monica:," wait a minute. what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?"
10,17,ross:, do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
10,17,monica:," oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our keys."
10,17,chandler:," oh, okay. "
10,17,phoebe:," so, i guess this is it."
10,17,joey:, yeah. i guess so.
10,17,monica:, this is harder than i thought it would be.
10,17,chandler:," oh, it's gonna be okay. "
10,17,rachel:," do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?"
10,17,monica:, we got some time.
10,17,rachel:," okay, should we get some coffee?"
