That is why we don't do it. I don't think that was my point. You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody? You know? I mean, what if you get one woman and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her. What are you talking about? One woman. That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla. You can get them with jimmy's or nuts. A whipped cream. This is the best thing that ever happened to you. You got married, you were like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon. I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny. Stay out of my freezer. Ever since she walked out on me what? You want to spell it out with noodles? No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation. So there's going to be a fifth date? Isn't there? Yeah, I think there is. What were you going to say? Well, ever since she left me, I haven't been able to perform sexually. I'm so sorry. Okay, I know being sit on is probably not what you need right now. How long? Two years. Wow. I'm glad you smashed your watch. Will, you still think you might want that fifth date? Yeah, I do. We are gathered here to join together joni Louise Cunningham and Charles Chachi. Chachi. Chachi. Our caller. In the bonds of holy matrimony, merit is the most sacred. Joni love chachi. That's the difference. Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon? Did the words Billy, don't be a hero mean anything to you? Great story, but I gotta go. I got a date with Andrea. Angela. Andrea. Oh, man. Andrea's the screamer. Angela has cats. Right. Thanks. It's Julie. I'm out of know. Here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to, you know, to ask a woman out, who am I going to ask? If you ever need holding, all my name now. Be there. Have you ever need holding? It's amazing. I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life. That is amazing. Congratulations. You know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do. No, I think it's if I can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't listen. Why? You're on a roll if you feel like you gotta make, like, a Western omelet or something. Although, actually, I'm really not that hungry. Oh, good. Lenny and Squiggy are here. Morning. Good morning. Morning, Paul. Hello, Paul. Hi. Paul, is it? Thank you. Thank you so much. No, I'm telling you, last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene and witness. We'll talk later. Yeah. Thank you. That wasn't a real date. What the hell do you do on a real date. Shut up and put my table back. All right, kids, I got to get to work. If I don't input those numbers, doesn't make much of a difference. So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff. Yeah, I'm an actor. Wow. But I've seen you in anything. Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work. Okay, unless you happen to catch the We Ones production of Pinocchio at the little Theater in the park. It was a job. All right, look, Geppetto, I'm a real live boy. I will not take this abuse. You're right. I'm sorry. Once I was a wooden boy a little. We should both know that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler. So how are you doing today? You sleep okay? You talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling. I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. I know he is. Just so you remember you and Tony DeMarco? Oh, yeah. Well, it's like that. With feelings. Oh, wow. Are you in trouble. Big time. Want a wedding dress? Hardly. You this time. I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves here. Okay, I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just going to get up and go to work. Oh, I wish we luck. What for? I'm going to go get one of those job things. Hey, Monica. Brandy. Welcome back. How was Florida? You had sex, didn't you? How do you do that? Oh, I hate you. I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex. So who? You know Paul? Paul? The wine guy? Oh, yeah, I know Paul. You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul? Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. You know, before me there was no snapping his turtle for two years. Of course, it was a why. Why would anybody do something like that? I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than to get you into bed. I hate men. I hate men. Oh, no, don't hate. You don't want to put that out in the universe. Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? All right, come here. Give me your feet. You know, I can't believe you didn't know it was a line. Guess what? You got a job. Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing. I was the last out of twelve interviews today. And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. Well, you would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale 50% off. Oh, how well you know me. They're my new. I don't need a job. I don't need my parents. I've got great boots. Boots? How'd you pay for them? Credit card. And who pays for, um, my? Oh, come on, you guys. Is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. Come on, Rachel. You can't live off your parents your whole life. I know that. That's why I was getting married. Come on, give her a break. It's hard being on your own for the first time. Thank you. You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was 14. My mom had just killed herself. And my stepdad was back in prison. And I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside Port Authority. And then he killed himself. And then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. The word you're looking for is anyway. All right, you ready? No, I'm not ready. How can I be ready? Hey, Rach, you ready to jump out of the airplane without a parachute? Come on, I can't do this. You can. I know you can. I don't think so. Come on, you made coffee. You can do anything. Cut. You know what? I think we can just leave it at that. Kind of like a symbolic gesture. Rachel, that was a library. You know, if you listen very closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. Welcome to the real world. It sucks. You're going to love it. That's it. You want to crash on the couch? No, I got to go home sometime. You're going to be okay? Yeah. Hang on. What's? What I just found on the floor. What? That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh, boy. All right. Good night, everybody. All right. No. Sorry. Oh, no. Go. Really, I don't want it split it. Okay. Thanks. You probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a major crush on you. I knew. You did? I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. I did. Oh. Listen, do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here, but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime, maybe? Yeah? Maybe. Okay. It okay. Maybe I will. Good night. Good night. Good it hey. What's with you? I just grabbed a spoon. I can't believe what I'm hearing here. I believe what I'm hearing here. What? I said you had an I said you have would you stop? Oh, was I doing it again? Yes, I said that you had a nice butt. It's just not a great butt. You wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit you. There's an image. Would anybody like more coffee? Did you make it or are you just serving it? I'm just serving it. Yeah. Kids, new dream. I'm in Las Vegas. Miss, more coffee? Excuse me. Could you give to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay. Las Vegas. Okay, so I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli.	1	1
