There's nothing to tell. Just some guy I work with. Come on, you're going out with the guy. There's got to be something wrong with him. All right, joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece. Wait, does he eat chalk? Just because I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl okay, everybody relax. Relax. This is not even a date. It's not? It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex. Sounds like a date to me. All right, so I'm back in high school. I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize I am totally naked. Then I look down and I realize there is a phone there. Instead of that's right? All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do. Everybody starts looking at me. They weren't looking at you before? Finally, I figure I'd better answer it. And it turns out it's my mother. Which is very, very weird because she never calls. Hi. This guy says, Hello, I want to kill myself. You okay, sweetie? I just feel like someone reached down my throat grabbed my small intestine pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck. Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today. Let me get you some. No, no, don't. Stop cleansing my aura. Don't. Just leave my aura alone, okay? Fine. Be murky. I'll be fine, all right? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy. No, you don't. No, I don't. To hell with her. She left me. And you never knew she was a lesbian? No. Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know. How should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian. Did I say that out loud? I told mom and dad last night. They they seemed to take it pretty well. Oh, really? So that hysterical phone call I got from a woman sobbing at 03:00 a.m. I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren was what? A wrong number? Sorry. All right, ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joint. Come on, you're single. Have some hormones. But I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again. And I just want a million dollars. Rachel? Oh, God, Monica. Hi. Thank God. I just went to your building and you weren't there. And then this guy with a big hammer said that you might be here. And you are. You are. Can I get you some coffee? Decaf. Hey, everybody. This is Rachel. And another Lincoln high survivor. This is everybody. This is Chandler and Phoebe and Joey. And you remember my brother, Ross. Sure. So you want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Oh, God. Well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in this room where we were keeping all the presents. And I was looking at this gravy boat this really gorgeous, lamoge gravy boat. When all of a sudden I realized sweet. And realized I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy bolt than by Barry. And then I got really freaked out. And that's when it hit me how much Barry looks like. I always know he looked familiar. But anyway, I just had to get out of there and I started wondering why am I doing this? And who am I doing this for? So anyway, I just didn't know where to go. And I know that you and I have kind of drifted apart but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city who wasn't invited to the wedding. Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue. Criminalisala De Marcela Singing all right, I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ and she's really not happy about it. Tuna. Egg salad, desa. I'll have whatever Christine is having. Daddy, I just I can't marry him. I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me. If I let go of my hair, my hip will fall off. She should not be wearing those pants. I'd say push her down the stairs. Push her down. Push. Come on, Daddy, listen to me. It's like it's like all of my life everyone has always told me, you're a shoe. You're a shoe. You're a shoe. You're a shoe. And then today I just stopped and I said what if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a purse? Or a hat? No, I don't want you to buy me a hat. I'm saying that I am a hat. It's a metaphor, Daddy. You can see where you'd have trouble. Look, Daddy, it's my life. Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. Well, I guess we've established she's staying here with Monica. Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait. I said maybe. It's breathe. Breathe. That's it. Just try to think of nice, calm things. Raindrops on roses and doorbells and sleigh bells and sing with mittens something and noodles with strings I'm all better now. I have okay, look, this is probably for the best. You know, independence, taking control of your life. The whole hat thing. And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live right across the hall, and he's away a lot. Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day. What, like there's a rule or something? I got it. Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound. It's Paul. Oh, God. Is it 630? Buz him in. Who's Paul? Paul, the wine guy, Paul? Maybe. Wait a minute. You're not a real date tonight is with Paul, the wine guy? He finally asked you out? Yes. Oh, this is a dear diary wait, wait. I can cancel. Oh, God. Please, no, go. I'll be fine. Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay? That'd be good. Really? No, go on. It's Paul. The wine guy? Does that mean does he sell it, drink it, or he just complains a lot? Hi. Come in. Paul, this is everybody. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it? Okay, I'll be right back. I've just got to go a wandering. Change. Okay. Sit down 2 seconds. Oh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good. Hey, Paul. Here's a little tip. She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again till it starts to get a little red. So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight? Well, I was kind of supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon. So nothing. Right? You're not even getting your no. No Avoke aruba this time of year. Talk about your big lizards. Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. Yes, and we're very excited about it. Actually, thanks, but I think I'm just going to hang out here tonight. It's been a long oh, sure. Okay, sure. Hey, Phoebe, do you want to help? Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to. Love is sweet as summer showers love is wondrous work of art but your love oh, your love your love is like a giant pigeon prepping on my heart thank you, la la. I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing. I see no worm guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs. I'm thinking. We got a bookcase here. It's a beautiful thing. What's this? I would have to say that it's an L shaped bracket. Which goes where? I have no idea. Done with the bookcase. This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can. I should have. Hey, if you're going to start with that stuff, we're out of here. Yes, please don't spoil all this fun. Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV what did you get? You guys? Oh, God. You got. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I know. I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when you started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that right now. He's such a mess. How did you get through it? You might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers. Say her leg. Me, I went for the watch. You actually broke her watch? Wow. The worst thing that I ever did was I shredded my old boyfriend's favorite bath towel. OOH. Steer clear of you. Barry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know you probably think this is all about what I said the other night about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't. It isn't. It's about me. And I didn't. Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me. It's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance to I'm divorced. I'm only 26 and I'm divorced. Shut up. Must stop. Shut up. Got to understand, between us, we haven't had a relationship that lasted longer than a mento. You, however, have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing, at the end of which she ripped your heart out. And that is why we don't do it. I don't think that was my point.	1	1
