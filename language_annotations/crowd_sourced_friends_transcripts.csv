5,20,rachel:, because a car backfired?,,

5,20,rachel:," ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience!",,
5,20,ross:," you weren't there! okay, maybe this is something that i i'm supposed to seize! y'know?",,

5,20,ross:, huh.,,
5,20,rachel:," i mean, look look today you escaped death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?",,

6,5,chandler:, i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,,
6,5,phoebe:, how did that happen?!!,,
6,5,chandler:," well, i was trying to prove that i was right. y'know? and it turns out i was wrong. and now it's lodged in my throat. ",,
6,5,monica:," damnit! y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler! ",,
6,5,judge:, okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,,
6,5,rachel:," yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",,
6,5,judge:, so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable.,,
6,5,ross:," fine, i'm mentally unstable.",,
6,5,judge:, and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user.,,
6,5,ross:, what?!,,
6,5,rachel:," uh yes, heroin and crack.",,
6,5,ross:, crack isn't even an intravenous drug!,,
6,5,rachel:," well, you would know.",,
6,5,judge:, now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,,
6,5,ross:," oh, come on!",,
6,5,rachel:," ross, please, i found the magazines!",,
6,5,judge:," and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.",,
6,5,ross:," okay, i'm sorry, this is insane! i i i'm not addicted to heroin, i'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! look, i'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",,
6,5,judge:, that won't be necessary.,,
6,5,ross:, and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!,,
6,5,rachel:, ugh!,,
6,5,judge:," now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.",,
6,5,rachel:," ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! and could you strike ""consummated like bunnies"" from the record?",,
6,5,judge:," is there, anything in this record that is actually true?",,
6,5,rachel:," well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think.",,
6,5,judge:," well, based on what i heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. if you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.",,
6,5,ross:," that's great! are you happy now? look what you did with your funny, funny form!",,
6,5,rachel:, what?! me?! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!,,
6,5,ross:, and what what are you typing that for? did you hear what she said? we don't get the annulment. don't type that! what?! stop typing! hey! stop typing! stop typing! stop typing!!,,
6,5,rachel:," okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!",,
6,5,judge:, you need to get out of my chambers.,,
6,5,rachel:," all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one!",,
6,5,ross:, yeah!,,

6,5,joey:," no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche.",,
6,5,monica:, and people will think you own a porsche because you're wearing the clothes?,,
6,5,joey:, of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! right?,,
6,5,chandler:, that is true.,,
6,5,phoebe:," yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",,
6,5,joey:," oh, i've been there. yeah, i am gonna go drive my porsche. ",,
6,5,monica:," joey, you know you don't actually have one.",,
6,5,joey:, come on! what are you doing?! i'm in character! would you talk to her! ,,

6,5,phoebe:, but you you can't leave me with them! we we're a team! we're playing a zone! they're gonna triple team me!,,
6,5,monica:," he's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.",,
6,5,phoebe:," but no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",,
6,5,chandler:, i think that's gum.,,
6,5,phoebe:, i'm pretty sure it's gun.,,
6,5,chandler:," okay, listen this really hurts. let's go.",,
6,5,phoebe:," a real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! no! what would, what would krog do? ",,
6,5,joey:, why isn't that valet back with my porsche?,,
6,5,passerby:, maybe because you've got the keys?,,

7,8,chandler:," extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! ",,
7,8,phoebe:," that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days ",,
7,8,chandler:, really? ,,
7,8,monica:," chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? ",,

7,8,rachel:, interesting. ,,
7,8,monica:," when it's your assistant, i would say never. ",,
7,8,joey:," all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you? all right? because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point. ",,
7,8,rachel:, huh. a moo point? ,,
7,8,joey:," yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. it just doesn't matter. it's moo. ",,
7,8,rachel:," have i been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",,
7,8,monica:," please, don't listen to joey, okay. would you look at him? he he's obviously depressed. he's away from his family; he's spending thanksgiving with strangers.   what he needs right now is for you to be his friend. ",,

7,8,tag:," it's weird. i always used to assume, that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. but lately it's like what if it's not. do you ever have that feeling? ",,
7,8,rachel:," no 'yeah, all the time, constantly. it's terrifying. but you know that i figure it 'it has to work out. ",,

7,8,rachel:," yeah, i admit it. i have a crush on you, and uh, and, and i know that's crazy because we work together, and and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing i want to do is is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.

7,22,rachel:," she puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is? it's a tradition left over from porsche's racing history. the world's greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday.  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat belts, put the car in gear and start it. the driver's left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24 hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat belts with his right hand. that's why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}",,
7,22,ross:, no ah ah ah! do not start this car! okay! okay! i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! ,,

9,3,monica:," well, if you really think about it, i mean four days is not that long. i mean, i see you monday before you go to work, and i see you thursday when you get back, and i always work late on tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. and well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",,

9,3,chandler:, does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?,,
9,3,ross:," hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!",,

9,8,amy:," my boyfriend canceled on me. i mean.. i i finally find a real relationship. i mean, someone that i can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. i swear, its almost not worth dating married guys. ",,
9,8,ross:, don't say that.,,

9,8,ross:," sure, you want to go upstairs? <ross and rachel go in the kitchen>",,
9,8,rachel:, um look i was thinking.. if its ok with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving.,,
9,8,ross:," you know, i think thats a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis.",,
9,8,rachel:," look i know she's a little tough to take. she has no where else to go, and she's my sister. alright, she's emma's aunt. and i would like them to bond. ",,
9,8,ross:," ok, fine, but i don't want them bonding to much. i don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job. ",,
9,8,rachel:," hi, hey.",,
9,8,rachel:," hey you guys, this is my sister amy.  this is chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon. ",,
9,8,everyone:, hi.,,
9,8,amy:, yeah.,,
9,8,amy:, phoe be.,,
9,8,amy:, oh. that's a funny noise. <monica and amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret closet>,,
9,8,joey:," pheebs, i still need some help here",,
9,8,phoebe:," oh right, ok um. ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . for example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying. ",,
9,8,joey:, hey. hey where's the baby?,,
9,8,rachel:, oh we just put her down for a nap.,,
9,8,amy:, thank you amy. ,,
9,8,amy:," no, no, then i would get the baby. i mean you know it would be just like a movie. like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her, then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then i'd get married. ",,
9,8,phoebe:, thats a great movie. <she claps> <joey nods in agreement>,,
9,8,amy:," now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. i was thinking about changing her name. i'm just not really a big fan of emily. ",,
9,8,ross:," emma, ross wants you. ",,
9,8,phoebe:, why does she keep making that noise? ,,
9,8,rachel:," honey, i don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to ross or to myself <ross and rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby. ",,
9,8,amy:, well who would?,,
9,8,ross:," well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want monica and chandler. ",,
9,8,chandler:, i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma. ,,
9,8,monica:," yeah oh my god, i'm so moved. ",,
9,8,amy:," i don't believe this, hold on a second. you guys die and i don't get your baby? ",,
9,8,rachel:," see look amy, we're a lot closer to monica and chandler. we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",,
9,8,amy:, connected? i mean.. to what? she's.. she's  a lump. ,,
9,8,chandler:," you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>",,
9,8,amy:, <points to chandler> this guy? seriously? later in the day.,,
9,8,monica:, woah. woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> woah. ,,
9,8,monica:," okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches ross' arm> ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.",,
9,8,joey:, hey! how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? do you not trust me with a fancy plate? ,,
9,8,monica:," no, honey, its. thats a special plate.  see its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. ",,
9,8,joey:, i can't believe i won.,,
9,8,amy:, its such a slap in the face. i'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.,,
9,8,rachel:, monica is ross' sister. ,,
9,8,amy:," no, ross' sister was really fat. ",,
9,8,monica:, that was me. ,,
9,8,amy:," no, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog. ",,
9,8,rachel:," okay, listen i know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. i mean, i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this. <monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat off with a knife>",,
9,8,monica:," now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun. ",,
9,8,amy:," okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do i get the baby?",,
9,8,chandler:," no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated at this comment> if monica dies then i would get emma, right? <ross and rachel pause and ponder this> ",,
9,8,rachel:, well actually...,,
9,8,chandler:, actually what? ,,
9,8,ross:," well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma would go to my parents. ",,
9,8,chandler:, what?,,
9,8,amy:, uh.. who has to die for me to get her? <everyone is looking around and at joey with looks of 'what?' on their faces> commercial break.,,
9,8,chandler:," no,  that that is not what we're saying.",,
9,8,joey:, yeah he's lying. he looked down. <joey looks to phoebe and she nods in agreement>,,
9,8,chandler:, well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! ,,
9,8,rachel:," honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be a wonderful parent. it's just.. you're more the fun parent. ",,
9,8,ross:, yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. ,,
9,8,monica:, no you're all about the fun. ,,
9,8,chandler:," look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think i'm not capable? ",,
9,8,ross:," no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together. ",,
9,8,chandler:, ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up. ,,
9,8,ross:," sure, monica would have to give her up. ",,
9,8,joey:," i lie better then that, right?",,
9,8,chandler:," so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",,
9,8,phoebe:, there's your movie! <claps> later on. monica opens her front door. chandler is sitting in the hallway. ,,
9,8,monica:, hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner. ,,
9,8,chandler:, oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly? ,,
9,8,monica:, ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about. i mean its not like their so responsible. emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom. ,,
9,8,chandler:," yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong father figure and i never will be. ",,
9,8,monica:, no you learn these things. you grow into it.,,
9,8,chandler:," yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it. ",,
9,8,monica:, i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts. ,,
9,8,chandler:," oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""go to your room! you're grounded""? ",,
9,8,monica:," can you hear me say ""you're grounded""?",,
9,8,chandler:, you said that to me last week. ,,
9,8,monica:, the producer from days left a message on my machine asking why i wasn't at the parade. they said everybody's pissed off at me.. <whiny voice> and they all got to meet santa! ,,
9,8,phoebe:, it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. you weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency. ,,
9,8,joey:," oh, i like that, yeah. wasn't at the parade because i had a family emergency.",,
9,8,phoebe:, oh.. my sister's raccoon.,,
9,8,phoebe:, no! nothing with a raccoon. ,,
9,8,joey:," arg... alright, i'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air> monica and chandler come through the front door.",,
9,8,monica:, oh wait.. what are you doing? ,,
9,8,joey:, setting the table. ,,
9,8,phoebe:, yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too. ,,
9,8,monica:, oh how nice. maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. he goes to chandler.,,
9,8,ross:," hey dude, you okay? sorry about before.",,
9,8,chandler:," ucch.  <pauses> uchh <louder this time> in case you hadn't noticed, i'm not talking to you. ",,
9,8,rachel:, uchh! <much louder and longer then amy's>,,
9,8,amy:, you know.. this.. this is classic rachel.,,
9,8,rachel:, yeah.. yeah right.. remember in high school when i died and didn't give you my baby?,,
9,8,amy:," this might be my one chance to have a baby rachel. i mean, you know that i have been so busy focusing on my carrer. ",,
9,8,rachel:, what? what carrer? ,,
9,8,amy:, um.. i'm a decorator. ,,
9,8,rachel:, ok. you decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. okay! i went to the zoo yesterday and now i'm a koala bear. ,,
9,8,amy:, why can't you ever be supportive? ,,
9,8,rachel:, sup.. you want to talk supportive? you didn't even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby. ,,
9,8,amy:, oh. yeah. well.. you didn't come see me when i was in the hospital when i was getting my lips done. ,,
9,8,rachel:, i did the first time! oh. oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> and you know what. you want to know why i'm not giving emily to you.,,
9,8,ross:, oh whose side are you on? <back to amy> i'm not giving you emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child. ,,
9,8,amy:, how hard could it be? you do it. ,,
9,8,joey:, ooh oooh.. ,,
9,8,amy:, do you want to know why you don't want  me to have the baby? ,,
9,8,rachel:, uh huh.,,
9,8,amy:, because you don't want me to be happy. you.. you have always been jealous of me. ,,
9,8,rachel:," jealous of what? of your lack of responsiblity? you, your immaturity? your total disregard of other people's feelings? ",,
9,8,amy:," uh.. to name a few.  you know.. you know.. you've just always been like this. you just have to have everything. and i couldn't have anything. like in junior high, when you stole timmy from me. i mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me? ",,
9,8,rachel:, timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,,
9,8,amy:," oh come on, that was 20 years ago. get over it.",,
9,8,rachel:," i cannot, i cannot believe that i invited you here today.",,
9,8,amy:," yeah, well you know what i cannot believe. that my so called sister, gets a 30% discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail.",,
9,8,rachel:, ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> it's forty five. ,,
9,8,amy:," too far, amy. too far. ",,
9,8,rachel:, you take that back.,,
9,8,amy:, no. ,,
9,8,rachel:, take it back!,,
9,8,amy:, no! what are you going to do? make me?,,
9,8,rachel:," heey man, i work out. <ross nods his head and points at her, in a yes manner> ",,
9,8,amy:, so do i.,,
9,8,rachel:, i do pilates. ,,
9,8,amy:, i do yoga.,,
9,8,rachel:, bring it on! <amy pushes rachel and monica goes berserk and runs around the table> ,,
9,8,monica:, put the plates in the boxes!! put the plates in the boxes! ,,
9,8,rachel:, did you just push me?,,
9,8,amy:," uh, yeah i think i did. ",,
9,8,rachel:, frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!! <they go back to fighting and then it really gets on>,,
9,8,phoebe:, oh my god! shouldn't we stop this?,,
9,8,joey:, what? are you out of your mind? lets throw some jello on them. <amy starts spitting on rachel's hand and rachel is saying ew and pushes her away> ,,
9,8,rachel:," ew! gross. <amy runs towards rachel and rachel puts her arm out, hand on amy's head and amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, rachel is moving backwards towards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to the floor> <everyone is shocked and monica faints and ross catches her> ",,
9,8,chandler:," alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out, but they're very important to monica. i want you to apologize to her right now. ",,
9,8,amy:, i'm sorry.,,
9,8,rachel:," mon, i'm so sorry. ",,
9,8,chandler:, sorry.,,
9,8,chandler:," by the way, that fight was totally arousing. ",,
9,8,ross:," dude. well done. you know what? if i die, and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma. ",,
9,8,chandler:, oh yeah? well thanks. ,,
9,8,ross:," so, so now do i get joey?",,
9,8,chandler:," okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose. <ross ponders that and walks away>",,
9,8,rachel:, are you okay mon? ,,
9,8,monica:, uh huh.. i mean these things happen. its' just a plate. its not like somebody died. ,,
9,8,phoebe:, thank you. it was so beautiful. <gets up and walks towards the front door> i'm going to go to joeys and get the pies. ,,
9,8,joey:," actually its not pies, its just pie. ",,

9,8,amy:, so you're going to give me the baby?,,

9,11,gavin:, i'll watch her.,,

9,11,chandler:," that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.",,
9,11,monica:, like a month?,,
9,11,chandler:, or a year?,,
9,11,monica:," really, you want to wait a year?",,
9,11,chandler:," it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. ""pants. like shorts, but longer."" it'll probably be more than a year. ",,

9,11,chandler:, i quit and you learn what i do?,,
9,11,monica:," it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. i mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. there's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons. ",,
9,11,chandler:, i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. ,,
9,11,monica:," it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, i won't have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? messes up all the ribbons?! what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? where will all the ribbons go!?!",,
9,11,chandler:, should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?,,

9,14,phoebe:," you know what? maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",,
9,14,joey:, yuck! but we should probably keep it down, she's still in the bedroom.,
9,14,phoebe:," so, what are we gonna do? are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",,
9,14,joey:, i know, that just pushes them further and further apart. ,

9,21,ross:, wow. what does that mean?,,
9,21,joey:," no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".",,
9,21,ross:, ok! so let's move on to the renaissance?,,
9,21,joey:," ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. touch it, it's really bumpy! .",,
9,21,ross:," nah ah! nah ah! no no no! no ad libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.",,

9,21,janice:," that's not the hard part honey! the hard part is what comes next, i mean aren't you worried about the results?",,
9,21,chandler:, i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.,,
9,21,janice:," oh! well, you know what? it probably is.",,
9,21,chandler:," yeah, but what if it's not? what if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?",,
9,21,janice:," oh, chandler, look. you and monica are meant to have children. i am sure it's gonna be just fine.",,
9,21,chandler:," oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...",,
9,21,janice:," what, you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?",,
9,21,chandler:," it was a ""wendy's!! "" ",,

9,21,rachel:, yah! she's... uhm... not very good though... ,,
9,21,phoebe:," uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",,
9,21,rachel:, i don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...,,
9,21,phoebe:, or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!,,
9,21,rachel:, phoebe!!,,
9,21,phoebe:, you know it's me?,,
9,21,rachel:," for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden!",,

9,21,rachel:," yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",,
9,21,phoebe:, tips not included.,,
9,21,rachel:," oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",,
9,21,phoebe:," because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know... you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! paying taxes!",,
9,21,rachel:," phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles and i so admire that! i don't have any!",,
9,21,phoebe:, you know what? you are right. i am gonna quit. it's time i took my life back!,,

9,21,ross:," hey, how was the met?",,
9,21,charlie:, the museum was amazing!,,
9,21,ross:," yeah? joey really knows his art, huh?",,
9,21,charlie:," not so much, no. he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.",,
9,21,ross:, what do you mean?,,
9,21,charlie:," well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.",,
9,21,ross:," wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right?",,
9,21,charlie:," no, we went to the left.",,

9,21,charlie:," yeah, it's fun .",,
9,21,ross:, what?,,
9,21,charlie:," actually, you know, joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.",,
9,21,ross:," what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",,
9,21,charlie:," well... i'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe i should be with someone... i have more in common with. you know what i mean?",,
9,21,ross:," yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",,
9,21,charlie:," yeah, i guess that's true.",,
9,21,ross:," and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that's the kind of guy joey is.",,
9,21,charlie:, he is very sweet. plus he's hot!,,
9,21,ross:, that was going to be my next argument. ,,

9,21,chandler:, actually it's both of us.,,

9,21,chandler:, apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.,,
9,21,monica:, oh... what does that mean?,,
9,21,chandler:, it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. it means...,,
9,21,monica:, chandler?,,
9,21,chandler:," it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.",,

9,22,monica:, i'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options.,,
9,22,monica:," above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! so, keep having sex on a regular basis.",,
9,22,chandler:," oh, damn it! ",,
9,22,monica:," ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.",,
9,22,monica:," and, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.",,
9,22,chandler:," is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! wow, talking about an inhospitable environment! ",,
9,22,rachel:," hi! ok, you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?",,

9,22,ross:, so so what did the doctor say?,,
9,22,chandler:," well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",,
9,22,joey:, so you're ruling out surrogacy?,,
9,22,chandler:, yeah.,,
9,22,joey:," so, i don't have to learn what that means?",,
9,22,chandler:," aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",,
9,22,joey:," enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs?",,
9,22,chandler:, ah ha!,,
9,22,ross:, how do you feel about all this?,,

9,22,ross:, mmm mm.,,
9,22,ross:," i mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. so so what i am saying is is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles! ",,
9,22,ross:, incentive for men?,,
9,22,phoebe:," oh, i'll take some of that.",,

9,22,charlie:," so, you know what, i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. where do you think those would be?",,

9,22,charlie:," wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!",,
9,22,rachel:, you know that depends on what it is! i've done a lot of stuff. ,,
9,22,phoebe:," so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie?",,
9,22,rachel:," she's ok, i just don't get a really good vibe from her!",,
9,22,phoebe:, why?,,
9,22,rachel:," i don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance!",,
9,22,phoebe:, who else?,,

9,22,phoebe:," uh, wow! isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",,
9,22,rachel:," oh, i get it!",,
9,22,phoebe:," oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",,
9,22,rachel:," i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal.",,
9,22,phoebe:, yeah.,,
9,22,rachel:, so can we keep this between us?,,
9,22,phoebe:, sure!,,

9,22,chandler:," well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",,
9,22,monica:," chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! ""come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm""!",,
9,22,chandler:," no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",,
9,22,monica:, chandler!,,
9,22,chandler:," i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go!",,
9,22,monica:, i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,,

10,1,rachel:," uh, look ross, this really isn't easy.",,
10,1,ross:," oh, it's all over everything. why? why me? ",,

10,1,joey:," no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... i think it's better if you tell him, you know. it's easier for a woman. that way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... i didn't mean it. i'm so so ooory. ",,
10,1,rachel:," yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",,

10,13,erica:," well, there is a chance it's another guy. i mean, i have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. ",,
10,13,chandler:," so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too? ",,
10,13,erica:," no, he's in prison. ",,
10,13,monica:, was he falsely accused of something? ,,
10,13,erica:," no... he killed his father with a shovel. but other than that, he's a great guy. ",,
10,13,chandler:, i'll bet his dad doesn't think so. ,,
10,13,monica:, are you awake? ,,
10,13,chandler:, of course i'm awake. assume from now on that i'm always awake! ,,

10,13,monica:, how? ,,
10,13,chandler:," i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?",,
10,13,monica:," yeah, but maybe we're just over reacting. ",,
10,13,chandler:," pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel wielding arm!   ",,
