## Language Annotations

The `friends` language annotation dataset is extracted for the naturalistic stimuli set [friends](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/friends.stimuli). The annotations were extracted using [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/). Annotations were structured into a `.json` file format, associating each audio or video file of the data with its own `json` file. Each `json` file contains the whole `transcript`, each single `word`, its `start` and `end` time points in seconds, and `confidence`, the probability value AssemblyAI gives regarding its success rate in identifying the word from the audio.

                "words":

                            "start": 18.97,
                            "end": 19.146,
                            "Confidence": 0.6398
                        }]
            }]
        }]
    }
